There are right places and wrong places. The right place isn’t on your sofa watching The Voice or slapping greenbacks into thongs at Betty’s Booty Cabaret, or down at the neighborhood bar getting jacked-up on Bud Light while watching the Dodgers lose another game. If you want to be at the right place at the right time you indeed have to be at the right place—and the right place knows which places are the wrong places.

conquering distance and gaining assurances that we are needed aren’t exercises to be performed only once; they have to be repeated every time there’s been a break – a day away, a busy period, an evening at work – for every interlude has the power once again to raise the question of whether or not we are still wanted. It’s therefore a pity how hard it is to find a stigma-free and winning way of admitting to the intensity of our need for reassurance. Even after years together, there remains a hurdle of fear around asking for a proof of desire.

Nature embeds in us insistent dreams of success. For the species, there must be an evolutionary advantage in being hard-wired for such striving; restlessness has given us cities, libraries, spaceships. But this impulse doesn’t leave much opportunity for individual equilibrium. The price of a few works of genius throughout history is a substantial portion of the human race being daily sickened by anxiety and mania.

Whoever we could meet would be radically imperfect: the stranger on the train, the old school acquaintance, the new friend online … Each of these, too, would be guaranteed to let us down. The facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. We were all (necessarily) less than ideally parented. We fight rather than explain, we nag rather than teach, we fret instead of analysing our worries, we lie and scatter blame where it doesn’t belong.

For this realization to sink in, it helps to have had a few lovers before settling down, not in order to have had a chance to locate ‘the right person’, but in order to have had an ample opportunity to discover at first hand, and in many different contexts, the truth that there isn’t any such person; and that everyone really is a bit wrong when considered from close up.

It’s profoundly counter-intuitive for us to think of ourselves as mad. We seem so normal and mostly so good – to ourselves. It’s everyone else who is out of step … And yet maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness. If we are not regularly deeply embarrassed by who we are, the journey to self-knowledge hasn’t begun.

We are ready for marriage when we accept that in a number of significant areas our partner will be wiser, more reasonable and more mature than we are. We should want to learn from them. We should bear having things pointed out to us. And at other moments we should be ready to model ourselves on the best pedagogues and deliver our suggestions without shouting or expecting the other simply to know. Only if we were already perfect could the idea of mutual education be dismissed as unloving.

The partner truly best suited to us is not the one who miraculously happens to share every taste, but the one who can negotiate differences in taste with intelligence and good grace. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate dissimilarity that is the true marker of the ‘right’ person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.

in love hoping we won’t find in another what we know is in ourselves, all the cowardice, weakness, laziness, dishonesty, compromise, and stupidity. We throw a cordon of love around the chosen one and decide that everything within it will somehow be free of our faults. We locate inside another a perfection that eludes us within ourselves, and through our union with the beloved, hope to maintain (against the evidence of all self-knowledge) a precarious faith in our species.

Why did this awareness not prevent my fall into love? Because the illogicality and childishness of my desire did not outweigh my need to believe. I knew the void that romantic intoxication could fill, I knew the exhilaration that comes from identifying someone, anyone, as admirable.

We fall in love because we long to escape from ourselves with someone as ideal as we are corrupt. But what if such a being were one day to turn around and love us back? We can only be shocked. How could they be divine as we had hoped when they have the bad taste to approve of someone like us?

Unrequited love may be painful, but it is safely painful, because it does not involve inflicting damage on anyone but oneself, a private pain that is as bitter-sweet as it is self-induced. But as soon as love is reciprocated, one must be prepared to give up the passivity of simply being hurt to take on the responsibility of perpetrating hurt oneself.

Albert Camus suggested that we fall in love with people because, from the outside, they look so whole, physically whole and emotionally ‘together’ – when subjectively, we feel dispersed and confused. We would not love if there were no lack within us, but we are offended by the discovery of a similar lack in the other. Expecting to find the answer, we find only the duplicate of our own problem.

There was something of this moral attitude in both Chloe’s and my behaviour. Framing her rejection, she had equated her inability to love with evil, and my love for her as evidence of goodness – hence the conclusion, made on the basis of nothing more than that I still desired her, that I was ‘too good’ for her. Assuming that she largely meant what she said and was not simply being polite, she had made the ethical point that she was not good enough for me, by virtue of nothing more than having ceased to love me – something she had deemed made her a less worthy person than I, a man who, in all the goodness of his heart, still felt able to love her.

The way forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left. Tell me three months, I’d spend time with family. Tell me one year, I’d write a book. Give me ten years, I’d get back to treating diseases. The truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I supposed to do with that day?

the physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.

make science the arbiter of metaphysics is to banish not only God from the world but also love, hate, meaning—to consider a world that is self-evidently not the world we live in. That’s not to say that if you believe in meaning, you must also believe in God. It is to say, though, that if you believe that science provides no basis for God, then you are almost obligated to conclude that science provides no basis for meaning and, therefore, life itself doesn’t have any. In other words, existential claims have no weight; all knowledge is scientific knowledge. Yet the paradox is that scientific methodology is the product of human hands and thus cannot reach some permanent truth. We build scientific theories to organize and manipulate the world, to reduce phenomena into manageable units. Science is based on reproducibility and manufactured objectivity. As strong as that makes its ability to generate claims about matter and energy, it also

makes scientific knowledge inapplicable to the existential, visceral nature of human life, which is unique and subjective and unpredictable. Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.

Yet I returned to the central values of Christianity—sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness—because I found them so compelling. There is a tension in the Bible between justice and mercy, between the Old Testament and the New Testament. And the New Testament says you can never be good enough: goodness is the thing, and you can never live up to it. The main message of Jesus, I believed, is that mercy trumps justice every time. Not only that, but maybe the basic message of original sin isn’t “Feel guilty all the time.” Maybe it is more along these lines: “We all have a notion of what it means to be good, and we can’t live up to it all the time.” Maybe that’s what the message of the New Testament is, after all.

Conversely, we knew that one trick to managing a terminal illness is to be deeply in love—to be vulnerable, kind, generous, grateful. A few months after his diagnosis, we sang the hymn “The Servant Song” while standing side by side in a church pew, and the words vibrated with meaning as we faced uncertainty and pain together: “I will share your joy and sorrow / Till we’ve seen this journey through.”

When Paul told me, immediately after his diagnosis, to remarry after he died, it exemplified the way he would, throughout his illness, work hard to secure my future. He was fiercely committed to ensuring the best for me, in our finances, my career, what motherhood would mean. At the same time, I worked hard to secure his present, to make his remaining time the best it could be, tracking and managing every symptom and aspect of his medical care—the most important doctoring role of my life—while supporting his ambitions, listening to

Sometimes making choices feels like planning for my life in a way that seems boring. Sometimes making choices to pursue things that seem like good fits, or that match my interests, seems boring simply because it makes sense. I find myself wanting to go off in an unexpected direction—Arabic! Cambodia! I know this is a sort of crazy impulse. I know that the way to live a good life is to pursue things that are not only interesting to you but that make sense.

The room turned grey, then white. The bed felt cold without him, and too large. I heard no sounds, and the stillness frightened me. It is like a tomb.

Every day, without him.

With time, a mutual rhythm emerged: we fought a civilized seven days out of ten, with time off for festivals and funerals. No raids, no surprise attacks. The leaders, once buoyant with hopes of swift victory, grew resigned to a lengthy engagement. The armies were remarkably well matched, could tussle on the field day after day with no side discernibly stronger. This was due in part to the soldiers who poured in from all over Anatolia to help the Trojans and make their names.

I developed a reputation, a standing in the camp. I was asked for, known for my quick hands and how little pain I caused. Less and less often Podalerius took his turn in the tent – I was the one who was there when Machaon was not. I began to surprise Achilles, calling out to these men as we walked through the camp. I was always gratified at how they would raise a hand in return, point to a scar that had healed over well. After they were gone, Achilles would shake his head. ‘I don’t know how you remember them all. I swear they look the same to me.’

The most difficult thing to cure is the patient’s attempt at self-cure. Very few lives are perfect and, because young people are generally resilient, many bounce back from difficulties with their own solutions in place. They may be outdated, imperfect solutions, but they are solutions nonetheless—ones that usually resist dismantling. A self-cure may seem harmless or subtle, such as the way Cathy soothed herself with music and men. Or it may be obviously troubling, like cutting or bingeing or getting high to numb out. Usually sometime during the twentysomething years, life changes and the old solutions seem cumbersome and out of place. The things that once helped us feel better now get in our way. It’s not OK to go to work with scars on our arms, and live-in girlfriends get tired of seeing us stoned. But we feel like we can’t stop listening to the same music or hooking up for a fleeting moment of attention. A self-cure can take on a life of its own. “Cathy, there’s a proverb that says ‘A raft is a good thing to have when you’re crossing a river. But when you get to the other side, put it down.’ ”

The power of these untold personal stories is that, like for Cathy, they can loop silently in our minds without anyone, sometimes even ourselves, knowing about them.

Tools. Things one could figure out. He understood right angles and clear instruction manuals. Assembly models and drawings. Things one could draw on paper. He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.

Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his. She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside.

“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away,” she said to him once, when he asked her why she had to be so upbeat the whole time.

Ove carried her upstairs to the bedroom. She nagged him for years about moving into the empty downstairs guest room, but Ove refused. After a decade or so she realized that this was his way of showing her that he had no intention of giving up. That God and the universe and all the other things would not be allowed to win. That the swine could go to hell. So she stopped nagging.

“Loving someone is like moving into a house,” Sonja used to say. “At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it’s cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”

Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it’s often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.

Something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him. There is no time to heal that sort of wound. And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps. Afternoons in the sun with someone’s hand clutched in one’s own. The fragrance of flowerbeds in fresh bloom. Sundays in a café. Grandchildren, perhaps. One finds a way of living for the sake of someone else’s future. And it wasn’t as if Ove also died when Sonja left him. He just stopped living. Grief is a strange thing.

’Tis a funny thing, reflected the Count as he stood ready to abandon his suite. From the earliest age, we must learn to say good-bye to friends and family. We see our parents and siblings off at the station; we visit cousins, attend schools, join the regiment; we marry, or travel abroad. It is part of the human experience that we are constantly gripping a good fellow by the shoulders and wishing him well, taking comfort from the notion that we will hear word of him soon enough. But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest possessions adieu. And if it were to? We wouldn’t welcome the education. For eventually, we come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance. This armoire, we are prone to recall, is the very one in which we hid as a boy; and it was these silver candelabra that lined our table on Christmas Eve; and it was with this handkerchief that she once dried her tears, et cetera, et cetera. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion. But, of course, a thing is just a thing.

Those who use what is called a growth mindset believe that people can change, that success is something to be achieved. Maybe it’s not the case that any person can be anything, but it is still true that within certain parameters, people can learn and grow.

Confidence doesn’t come from the inside out. It moves from the outside in. People feel less anxious—and more confident—on the inside when they can point to things they have done well on the outside. Fake confidence comes from stuffing our self-doubt. Empty confidence comes from parental platitudes on our lunch hour. Real confidence comes from mastery experiences, which are actual, lived moments of success, especially when things seem difficult. Whether we are talking about love or work, the confidence that overrides insecurity comes from experience. There is no other way.

Flow is one key to what we call adult play, and a really rewarding and satisfying career involves a lot of flow states. The essence of play is being fully immersed and joyful in what you’re doing, without being constantly distracted by concerns about the outcomes. When we’re in flow, that’s exactly what’s going on—we are fully present to what we’re doing, so present we don’t even notice time. Seen this way, flow is something we should strive to make a regular part of our work life (and home life, and exercise life, and love life…you get the idea).

Nowadays, many of us are knowledge workers, and we use our brains to do the heavy lifting. The brain is a very energy-hungry organ. Of the roughly two thousand calories we consume a day, five hundred go to running our brains. That’s astonishing: the brain represents only about 2 percent of our body weight, and yet it takes up 25 percent of the energy we consume every day. It’s no wonder that the way we invest our attention is critical to whether or not we feel high or low energy.

Here’s another key element when you’re wayfinding in life: follow the joy; follow what engages and excites you, what brings you alive. Most people are taught that work is always hard and that we have to suffer through it. Well, there are parts of any job or any career that are hard and annoying—but if most of what you do at work is not bringing you alive, then it’s killing you. It’s your career, after all, and you are going to be spending a lot of time doing it—we calculate it at 90,000 to 125,000 hours during the course of your lifetime.

This is not a book about making passive income. While I’m on board with creating assets that mean revenue flows automatically, I’m not on board with the pursuit of income for the sake of it. I don’t think a business needs to be reduced to just its financial aspect. Solely seeking passive income is shallow. It’s not endearing. It misses out the best parts of running and growing a business: the amazing work you get to do, the inspiring people you get to work with, the opportunities you get to seize. As it happens, focusing on service and significance will create passive income much faster than focusing on money.

An indoctrination process is at play for much of life that we take for granted. Inception comes first; introduction of the concept followed by the subtle messaging that it is a good idea. Then comes awareness. Suddenly you see that purchase you toyed with everywhere. It must be a sign! Then we see others making that decision, which reinforces our plans – so we make them, too. Social media adds a new level of awareness and means trends can spread beyond local friendship groups or workplaces and across the world.

Swapping passion for intention means taking a spark of interest and turning it into a plan. And the plan is a new plan, not the one everyone else is following.

Author David Epstein, when researching generalists and specialists, found that progress in many fields, including science, occurs at the interfaces. He found that scientists with a narrow specialty often missed opportunities to make breakthroughs that required wider knowledge.

This is where generalists thrive. They can grasp the structure of a concept and find similar structures from other fields. They can use analogies to explain a solution or find a way forward. They bring a wide field of knowledge to narrow ones and come up with ideas that seem wacky but are actually genius. The interfaces between two fields are where those unexplored opportunities lie.

While this way of thinking might come naturally, we can’t leave it to chance. Pick a few industries to keep abreast of. Research new inventions or breakthroughs and find out how they were discovered. Or ask a friend in a different field about their work.

How would your actions change if you knew someone was observing and narrating your every move? While this might sound creepy, knowing that someone is watching brings awareness because we see our actions through someone else’s eyes. It might mean we act like the best versions of ourselves. We show the side we want people to see. How do you act when you suspect someone is watching?

three functional sections: the visionary part, the routine part and the amygdala, responsible for what is known as the ‘lizard brain’. The visionary part, when in charge, means we are creative and forward-thinking. We can plan ahead and feel excited about the possibilities. We can dream big about what’s possible and feel as if our capability has no limits.

amygdala, which incorporates the lizard brain. This is the part responsible for fight or flight. It’s in charge of fear. It wants everything to stay the same because it views change as scary, and it will invent excuses and stories to ensure a stable footing. The lizard brain is scanning for danger and worrying about what might lie ahead.

If I’m feeling tired or hungry, if I haven’t been outside that day or am feeling uninspired, I can sense myself slipping into a fear-based mentality. The faster I can notice and change it, the better I will become at leading my life from the best version of myself. Training your amygdala to be less reactive leads to more resilience and less stress.

Gabrielle Bernstein advocates her ‘choose again method’ for moving from fear to love, an approach that leaders can incorporate into their day. The steps include: noticing your negative or fearful thought forgiving the thought recognizing the role of undesirable thoughts in showing you what you actually want choosing again, with the best alternative feeling you can muster.

It means reframing a busy calendar as a chance to meet amazing people. Uncertainty about a team member’s work becomes a chance to talk them through what’s expected and hear their ideas for change. A difficult conversation with a supplier becomes an opportunity to find a better solution. When you consciously begin to follow the choose again process, it starts to come naturally. When I feel my lizard brain leading, I don’t talk to anyone. I know that not every word I say will be true to who I am and what I know.

Scarcity implies a zero-sum game. It encourages holding your cards close to your chest, looking to take rather than give, and preserving what you have over looking for more. Abundance mentality means you believe there is plenty to go around and that if I help you, we all win. Abundance mentality encourages openness, giving, sharing and spreading good vibes without keeping score. There is always a way of making more money or finding opportunities. There are chances to do so everywhere, but only if you think with an abundance mindset. Believing in abundance changes your energy and brings a ripple effect. Without expectation of return, you receive favours and support.

Like Walt Disney, who said, ‘We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies,’ you might have a mission to fulfil and an audience to serve, and financial reimbursement is a happy by-product of the value you bring. You might be in the top 1 per cent of earners because you deliver value to people who want more of it, but you’re not dependent on the money and it doesn’t define you.

Oprah explained, ‘It’s not that I’ve always known who I would be. It was just very clear to me from an early age who I wouldn’t be.’ As you’re reading this book, start to believe without a shadow of a doubt that great things are possible for you. When I talk about the incredible time you’re going to have, I want you to feel without a doubt that what I describe is yours for the taking. You have to believe it in every bone of your body. If you don’t, it’s because something else is at play: You’ve fallen into a normal way of living and you don’t question enough. Or you hang out with the wrong people. Or something in your past is trying to own your future. Or you aren’t sufficiently self-aware. Or you become distracted before making improvements.

I chose to read every ‘you can’t’ as: There’s a way forward here, but only if you’re determined. There’s no formula for the way through the ‘you can’ts’, so there’s no step-by-step guide to follow. There is no replicable way of succeeding, only replicable ways of failing. Every great success happens when someone questions rather than mimics.

Be intentional about the way you think by being intentional about what you share and with whom. If you can’t find someone who has done something you want to do, find someone who believes in possibilities. Someone who is curious enough to think about how. Someone who has already found a way around obstacles, can come up with ideas on the spot, or has a knack for being jammy. Jammy people can apply their thinking to any situation and are great to have in your life.

Most people achieve a tiny fraction of what they are capable of. They settle for less. They get comfortable. They listen to naysayers. They believe uninspiring assertions about their place in the world. They don’t question who they are and what they stand for. They don’t push themselves beyond their comfort zone. They create excuses for why they haven’t achieved more, and they start to believe them.

There is little that raises your sense of self-awareness like journalling. Nothing that holds you to account better than writing things down in your diary. Assessing your day. Knowing yourself. Knowing what you want and what you don’t want. Picking apart what you did well and where you want to improve. Having a complete sense of who you are and what you’re here to do. You look back at challenging times and remember how you smashed through them to where you are now.
