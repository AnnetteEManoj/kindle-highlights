There are right places and wrong places. The right place isn’t on your sofa watching The Voice or slapping greenbacks into thongs at Betty’s Booty Cabaret, or down at the neighborhood bar getting jacked-up on Bud Light while watching the Dodgers lose another game. If you want to be at the right place at the right time you indeed have to be at the right place—and the right place knows which places are the wrong places.

conquering distance and gaining assurances that we are needed aren’t exercises to be performed only once; they have to be repeated every time there’s been a break – a day away, a busy period, an evening at work – for every interlude has the power once again to raise the question of whether or not we are still wanted. It’s therefore a pity how hard it is to find a stigma-free and winning way of admitting to the intensity of our need for reassurance. Even after years together, there remains a hurdle of fear around asking for a proof of desire.

Nature embeds in us insistent dreams of success. For the species, there must be an evolutionary advantage in being hard-wired for such striving; restlessness has given us cities, libraries, spaceships. But this impulse doesn’t leave much opportunity for individual equilibrium. The price of a few works of genius throughout history is a substantial portion of the human race being daily sickened by anxiety and mania.

Whoever we could meet would be radically imperfect: the stranger on the train, the old school acquaintance, the new friend online … Each of these, too, would be guaranteed to let us down. The facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. We were all (necessarily) less than ideally parented. We fight rather than explain, we nag rather than teach, we fret instead of analysing our worries, we lie and scatter blame where it doesn’t belong.

For this realization to sink in, it helps to have had a few lovers before settling down, not in order to have had a chance to locate ‘the right person’, but in order to have had an ample opportunity to discover at first hand, and in many different contexts, the truth that there isn’t any such person; and that everyone really is a bit wrong when considered from close up.

It’s profoundly counter-intuitive for us to think of ourselves as mad. We seem so normal and mostly so good – to ourselves. It’s everyone else who is out of step … And yet maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness. If we are not regularly deeply embarrassed by who we are, the journey to self-knowledge hasn’t begun.

We are ready for marriage when we accept that in a number of significant areas our partner will be wiser, more reasonable and more mature than we are. We should want to learn from them. We should bear having things pointed out to us. And at other moments we should be ready to model ourselves on the best pedagogues and deliver our suggestions without shouting or expecting the other simply to know. Only if we were already perfect could the idea of mutual education be dismissed as unloving.

The partner truly best suited to us is not the one who miraculously happens to share every taste, but the one who can negotiate differences in taste with intelligence and good grace. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate dissimilarity that is the true marker of the ‘right’ person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.

in love hoping we won’t find in another what we know is in ourselves, all the cowardice, weakness, laziness, dishonesty, compromise, and stupidity. We throw a cordon of love around the chosen one and decide that everything within it will somehow be free of our faults. We locate inside another a perfection that eludes us within ourselves, and through our union with the beloved, hope to maintain (against the evidence of all self-knowledge) a precarious faith in our species.

Why did this awareness not prevent my fall into love? Because the illogicality and childishness of my desire did not outweigh my need to believe. I knew the void that romantic intoxication could fill, I knew the exhilaration that comes from identifying someone, anyone, as admirable.

We fall in love because we long to escape from ourselves with someone as ideal as we are corrupt. But what if such a being were one day to turn around and love us back? We can only be shocked. How could they be divine as we had hoped when they have the bad taste to approve of someone like us?

Unrequited love may be painful, but it is safely painful, because it does not involve inflicting damage on anyone but oneself, a private pain that is as bitter-sweet as it is self-induced. But as soon as love is reciprocated, one must be prepared to give up the passivity of simply being hurt to take on the responsibility of perpetrating hurt oneself.

Albert Camus suggested that we fall in love with people because, from the outside, they look so whole, physically whole and emotionally ‘together’ – when subjectively, we feel dispersed and confused. We would not love if there were no lack within us, but we are offended by the discovery of a similar lack in the other. Expecting to find the answer, we find only the duplicate of our own problem.

There was something of this moral attitude in both Chloe’s and my behaviour. Framing her rejection, she had equated her inability to love with evil, and my love for her as evidence of goodness – hence the conclusion, made on the basis of nothing more than that I still desired her, that I was ‘too good’ for her. Assuming that she largely meant what she said and was not simply being polite, she had made the ethical point that she was not good enough for me, by virtue of nothing more than having ceased to love me – something she had deemed made her a less worthy person than I, a man who, in all the goodness of his heart, still felt able to love her.

The way forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left. Tell me three months, I’d spend time with family. Tell me one year, I’d write a book. Give me ten years, I’d get back to treating diseases. The truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I supposed to do with that day?

the physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.

make science the arbiter of metaphysics is to banish not only God from the world but also love, hate, meaning—to consider a world that is self-evidently not the world we live in. That’s not to say that if you believe in meaning, you must also believe in God. It is to say, though, that if you believe that science provides no basis for God, then you are almost obligated to conclude that science provides no basis for meaning and, therefore, life itself doesn’t have any. In other words, existential claims have no weight; all knowledge is scientific knowledge. Yet the paradox is that scientific methodology is the product of human hands and thus cannot reach some permanent truth. We build scientific theories to organize and manipulate the world, to reduce phenomena into manageable units. Science is based on reproducibility and manufactured objectivity. As strong as that makes its ability to generate claims about matter and energy, it also

makes scientific knowledge inapplicable to the existential, visceral nature of human life, which is unique and subjective and unpredictable. Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.

Yet I returned to the central values of Christianity—sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness—because I found them so compelling. There is a tension in the Bible between justice and mercy, between the Old Testament and the New Testament. And the New Testament says you can never be good enough: goodness is the thing, and you can never live up to it. The main message of Jesus, I believed, is that mercy trumps justice every time. Not only that, but maybe the basic message of original sin isn’t “Feel guilty all the time.” Maybe it is more along these lines: “We all have a notion of what it means to be good, and we can’t live up to it all the time.” Maybe that’s what the message of the New Testament is, after all.

Conversely, we knew that one trick to managing a terminal illness is to be deeply in love—to be vulnerable, kind, generous, grateful. A few months after his diagnosis, we sang the hymn “The Servant Song” while standing side by side in a church pew, and the words vibrated with meaning as we faced uncertainty and pain together: “I will share your joy and sorrow / Till we’ve seen this journey through.”

When Paul told me, immediately after his diagnosis, to remarry after he died, it exemplified the way he would, throughout his illness, work hard to secure my future. He was fiercely committed to ensuring the best for me, in our finances, my career, what motherhood would mean. At the same time, I worked hard to secure his present, to make his remaining time the best it could be, tracking and managing every symptom and aspect of his medical care—the most important doctoring role of my life—while supporting his ambitions, listening to

Sometimes making choices feels like planning for my life in a way that seems boring. Sometimes making choices to pursue things that seem like good fits, or that match my interests, seems boring simply because it makes sense. I find myself wanting to go off in an unexpected direction—Arabic! Cambodia! I know this is a sort of crazy impulse. I know that the way to live a good life is to pursue things that are not only interesting to you but that make sense.

The room turned grey, then white. The bed felt cold without him, and too large. I heard no sounds, and the stillness frightened me. It is like a tomb.

Every day, without him.

With time, a mutual rhythm emerged: we fought a civilized seven days out of ten, with time off for festivals and funerals. No raids, no surprise attacks. The leaders, once buoyant with hopes of swift victory, grew resigned to a lengthy engagement. The armies were remarkably well matched, could tussle on the field day after day with no side discernibly stronger. This was due in part to the soldiers who poured in from all over Anatolia to help the Trojans and make their names.

I developed a reputation, a standing in the camp. I was asked for, known for my quick hands and how little pain I caused. Less and less often Podalerius took his turn in the tent – I was the one who was there when Machaon was not. I began to surprise Achilles, calling out to these men as we walked through the camp. I was always gratified at how they would raise a hand in return, point to a scar that had healed over well. After they were gone, Achilles would shake his head. ‘I don’t know how you remember them all. I swear they look the same to me.’

The most difficult thing to cure is the patient’s attempt at self-cure. Very few lives are perfect and, because young people are generally resilient, many bounce back from difficulties with their own solutions in place. They may be outdated, imperfect solutions, but they are solutions nonetheless—ones that usually resist dismantling. A self-cure may seem harmless or subtle, such as the way Cathy soothed herself with music and men. Or it may be obviously troubling, like cutting or bingeing or getting high to numb out. Usually sometime during the twentysomething years, life changes and the old solutions seem cumbersome and out of place. The things that once helped us feel better now get in our way. It’s not OK to go to work with scars on our arms, and live-in girlfriends get tired of seeing us stoned. But we feel like we can’t stop listening to the same music or hooking up for a fleeting moment of attention. A self-cure can take on a life of its own. “Cathy, there’s a proverb that says ‘A raft is a good thing to have when you’re crossing a river. But when you get to the other side, put it down.’ ”

The power of these untold personal stories is that, like for Cathy, they can loop silently in our minds without anyone, sometimes even ourselves, knowing about them.

Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his. She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside.

“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away,” she said to him once, when he asked her why she had to be so upbeat the whole time.

Ove carried her upstairs to the bedroom. She nagged him for years about moving into the empty downstairs guest room, but Ove refused. After a decade or so she realized that this was his way of showing her that he had no intention of giving up. That God and the universe and all the other things would not be allowed to win. That the swine could go to hell. So she stopped nagging.

“Loving someone is like moving into a house,” Sonja used to say. “At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it’s cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”

Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it’s often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.

Something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him. There is no time to heal that sort of wound. And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps. Afternoons in the sun with someone’s hand clutched in one’s own. The fragrance of flowerbeds in fresh bloom. Sundays in a café. Grandchildren, perhaps. One finds a way of living for the sake of someone else’s future. And it wasn’t as if Ove also died when Sonja left him. He just stopped living. Grief is a strange thing.

’Tis a funny thing, reflected the Count as he stood ready to abandon his suite. From the earliest age, we must learn to say good-bye to friends and family. We see our parents and siblings off at the station; we visit cousins, attend schools, join the regiment; we marry, or travel abroad. It is part of the human experience that we are constantly gripping a good fellow by the shoulders and wishing him well, taking comfort from the notion that we will hear word of him soon enough. But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest possessions adieu. And if it were to? We wouldn’t welcome the education. For eventually, we come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance. This armoire, we are prone to recall, is the very one in which we hid as a boy; and it was these silver candelabra that lined our table on Christmas Eve; and it was with this handkerchief that she once dried her tears, et cetera, et cetera. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion. But, of course, a thing is just a thing.

Those who use what is called a growth mindset believe that people can change, that success is something to be achieved. Maybe it’s not the case that any person can be anything, but it is still true that within certain parameters, people can learn and grow.

Confidence doesn’t come from the inside out. It moves from the outside in. People feel less anxious—and more confident—on the inside when they can point to things they have done well on the outside. Fake confidence comes from stuffing our self-doubt. Empty confidence comes from parental platitudes on our lunch hour. Real confidence comes from mastery experiences, which are actual, lived moments of success, especially when things seem difficult. Whether we are talking about love or work, the confidence that overrides insecurity comes from experience. There is no other way.

Flow is one key to what we call adult play, and a really rewarding and satisfying career involves a lot of flow states. The essence of play is being fully immersed and joyful in what you’re doing, without being constantly distracted by concerns about the outcomes. When we’re in flow, that’s exactly what’s going on—we are fully present to what we’re doing, so present we don’t even notice time. Seen this way, flow is something we should strive to make a regular part of our work life (and home life, and exercise life, and love life…you get the idea).

Nowadays, many of us are knowledge workers, and we use our brains to do the heavy lifting. The brain is a very energy-hungry organ. Of the roughly two thousand calories we consume a day, five hundred go to running our brains. That’s astonishing: the brain represents only about 2 percent of our body weight, and yet it takes up 25 percent of the energy we consume every day. It’s no wonder that the way we invest our attention is critical to whether or not we feel high or low energy.

Here’s another key element when you’re wayfinding in life: follow the joy; follow what engages and excites you, what brings you alive. Most people are taught that work is always hard and that we have to suffer through it. Well, there are parts of any job or any career that are hard and annoying—but if most of what you do at work is not bringing you alive, then it’s killing you. It’s your career, after all, and you are going to be spending a lot of time doing it—we calculate it at 90,000 to 125,000 hours during the course of your lifetime. If it’s not fun, a lot of your life is going to suck.

Bill adjusted his schedule to surround these less engaging activities with more engaging activities, and to give himself small rewards when he completes “energy-negative” tasks. The best way to deal with these energy-negative activities is to make sure that you are well rested and have the energy reserves needed to “do them right.” Otherwise, you might find yourself doing them again—costing you more energy than they should.

This is not a book about making passive income. While I’m on board with creating assets that mean revenue flows automatically, I’m not on board with the pursuit of income for the sake of it. I don’t think a business needs to be reduced to just its financial aspect. Solely seeking passive income is shallow. It’s not endearing. It misses out the best parts of running and growing a business: the amazing work you get to do, the inspiring people you get to work with, the opportunities you get to seize. As it happens, focusing on service and significance will create passive income much faster than focusing on money.

An indoctrination process is at play for much of life that we take for granted. Inception comes first; introduction of the concept followed by the subtle messaging that it is a good idea. Then comes awareness. Suddenly you see that purchase you toyed with everywhere. It must be a sign! Then we see others making that decision, which reinforces our plans – so we make them, too. Social media adds a new level of awareness and means trends can spread beyond local friendship groups or workplaces and across the world.

When a life decision, purchase or way of acting seems the normal thing to do, many will do it without questioning. Humans naturally want to stay away from danger, a proclivity that has been used to condition us to conform and not question. We are rewired to blindly follow.

Author David Epstein, when researching generalists and specialists, found that progress in many fields, including science, occurs at the interfaces. He found that scientists with a narrow specialty often missed opportunities to make breakthroughs that required wider knowledge.

This is where generalists thrive. They can grasp the structure of a concept and find similar structures from other fields. They can use analogies to explain a solution or find a way forward. They bring a wide field of knowledge to narrow ones and come up with ideas that seem wacky but are actually genius. The interfaces between two fields are where those unexplored opportunities lie.

How would your actions change if you knew someone was observing and narrating your every move? While this might sound creepy, knowing that someone is watching brings awareness because we see our actions through someone else’s eyes. It might mean we act like the best versions of ourselves. We show the side we want people to see. How do you act when you suspect someone is watching?

three functional sections: the visionary part, the routine part and the amygdala, responsible for what is known as the ‘lizard brain’. The visionary part, when in charge, means we are creative and forward-thinking. We can plan ahead and feel excited about the possibilities. We can dream big about what’s possible and feel as if our capability has no limits.

amygdala, which incorporates the lizard brain. This is the part responsible for fight or flight. It’s in charge of fear. It wants everything to stay the same because it views change as scary, and it will invent excuses and stories to ensure a stable footing.

If I’m feeling tired or hungry, if I haven’t been outside that day or am feeling uninspired, I can sense myself slipping into a fear-based mentality. The faster I can notice and change it, the better I will become at leading my life from the best version of myself.

Gabrielle Bernstein advocates her ‘choose again method’ for moving from fear to love, an approach that leaders can incorporate into their day. The steps include: noticing your negative or fearful thought forgiving the thought recognizing the role of undesirable thoughts in showing you what you actually want choosing again, with the best alternative feeling you can muster.

It means reframing a busy calendar as a chance to meet amazing people. Uncertainty about a team member’s work becomes a chance to talk them through what’s expected and hear their ideas for change. A difficult conversation with a supplier becomes an opportunity to find a better solution. When you consciously begin to follow the choose again process, it starts to come naturally. When I feel my lizard brain leading, I don’t talk to anyone. I know that not every word I say will be true to who I am and what I know.

Scarcity implies a zero-sum game. It encourages holding your cards close to your chest, looking to take rather than give, and preserving what you have over looking for more. Abundance mentality means you believe there is plenty to go around and that if I help you, we all win. Abundance mentality encourages openness, giving, sharing and spreading good vibes without keeping score. There is always a way of making more money or finding opportunities. There are chances to do so everywhere, but only if you think with an abundance mindset. Believing in abundance changes your energy and brings a ripple effect. Without expectation of return, you receive favours and support.

Like Walt Disney, who said, ‘We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies,’ you might have a mission to fulfil and an audience to serve, and financial reimbursement is a happy by-product of the value you bring. You might be in the top 1 per cent of earners because you deliver value to people who want more of it, but you’re not dependent on the money and it doesn’t define you.

Oprah explained, ‘It’s not that I’ve always known who I would be. It was just very clear to me from an early age who I wouldn’t be.’ As you’re reading this book, start to believe without a shadow of a doubt that great things are possible for you. When I talk about the incredible time you’re going to have, I want you to feel without a doubt that what I describe is yours for the taking. You have to believe it in every bone of your body. If you don’t, it’s because something else is at play: You’ve fallen into a normal way of living and you don’t question enough. Or you hang out with the wrong people. Or something in your past is trying to own your future. Or you aren’t sufficiently self-aware. Or you become distracted before making improvements.

I chose to read every ‘you can’t’ as: There’s a way forward here, but only if you’re determined. There’s no formula for the way through the ‘you can’ts’, so there’s no step-by-step guide to follow. There is no replicable way of succeeding, only replicable ways of failing. Every great success happens when someone questions rather than mimics.

Be intentional about the way you think by being intentional about what you share and with whom. If you can’t find someone who has done something you want to do, find someone who believes in possibilities. Someone who is curious enough to think about how. Someone who has already found a way around obstacles, can come up with ideas on the spot, or has a knack for being jammy. Jammy people can apply their thinking to any situation and are great to have in your life.

Most people achieve a tiny fraction of what they are capable of. They settle for less. They get comfortable. They listen to naysayers. They believe uninspiring assertions about their place in the world. They don’t question who they are and what they stand for. They don’t push themselves beyond their comfort zone. They create excuses for why they haven’t achieved more, and they start to believe them.

But we pick them up when we are young and repeat them until we believe they are true. Did you ever hear these phrases used? Money doesn’t grow on trees – instilling the belief that money is scarce and difficult to find. It’s too expensive – creating an association between high price and low value. He’s ripping you off – judging the character of someone selling premium products. She got lucky – underplaying someone’s ability to earn well.

Train yourself to notice limiting beliefs and unhelpful thoughts so as to remove them from your head and vocabulary. Subtract anything in your life that doesn’t reflect the best version of you that exists. How do you break free from limiting beliefs? One way is to unpack them and reassert the opposite. Another is to find role models, examples and reminders that others have succeeded in the way you want to. Or in any way at all.

Without doing work you enjoy, without being genuinely interested in what you’re doing, without waking up raring to go, each day will feel like a slog and you won’t see your career through. You’ll look for escapes, start side projects or succumb to distraction. Great businesses are built on authenticity and sincerity. This path isn’t about making a quick buck; it’s about a mission that other people buy into as strongly as you. It means work doesn’t feel like work.

What are my unique strengths in making this happen? If not now, when? Asking bigger questions forces your brain to scramble to answer them.

"Everyone knows they're going to die," he said again, "but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently." So we kid ourselves about death, I said. "Yes. But there's a better approach. To know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That's better. That way you can actually be more involved in your life while you're living."

"The truth is, Mitch," he said, "once you learn how to die, you learn how to live." I nodded. "I'm going to say it again," he said. "Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live." He smiled, and I realized what he was doing. He was making sure I absorbed this point, without embarrassing me by asking. It was part of what made him a good teacher.

But everyone knows someone who has died, I said. Why is it so hard to think about dying? "Because," Morrie continued, "most of us all walk around as if we're sleepwalking. We really don't experience the world fully, because we're half-asleep, doing things we automatically think we have to do." And facing death changes all that?

"Mitch," he said, laughing along, "even I don't know what `spiritual development' really means. But I do know we're deficient in some way. We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don't satisfy us. The loving relationships we have, the universe around us, we take these things for granted."

"The fact is, there is no foundation, no secure ground, upon which people may stand today if it isn't the family. It's become quite clear to me as I've been sick. If you don't have the support and love and caring and concern that you get from a family, you don't have much at all. Love is so supremely important. As our great poet Auden said, `Love each other or perish.' "

"This is part of what a family is about, not just love, but letting others know there's someone who is watching out for them. It's what I missed so much when my mother died-what I call your `spiritual security'-knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame."

There is no experience like having children.' That's all. There is no substitute for it. You cannot do it with a friend. You cannot do it with a lover. If you want the experience of having complete responsibility for another human being, and to learn how to love and bond in the deepest way, then you should have children." So you would do it again? I asked. I glanced at the photo. Rob was kissing Morrie on the forehead, and Morrie was laughing with his eyes closed. "Would I do it again?" he said to me, looking surprised. "Mitch, I would not have missed that experience for anything. Even though . . . " He swallowed and put the picture in his lap. "Even though there is a painful price to pay," he said. Because you'll be leaving them. "Because I'll be leaving them soon."

So once again, I dove into work. I worked because I could control it. I worked because work was sensible and responsive. And each time I would call my brother's apartment in Spain and get the answering machine-him speaking in Spanish, another sign of how far apart we had drifted-I would hang up and work some more. Perhaps this is one reason I was drawn to Morrie. He let me be where my brother would not. Looking back, perhaps Morrie knew this all along.

I visualized the most relaxed, confident version of me meeting potential buyers and getting on well with them. I imagined the heads of terms arriving, reading it, and confidently nodding, knowing this was the way forward. I pictured sailing through due diligence, enjoying the process and telling my friends. In the end, our sale price was exactly the amount I had written down, and due diligence was a breeze.

Visualization can be a powerful tool. Visualizing the future you want to make happen means that when it happens, it’s not a surprise. You’ve seen it before. It feels familiar and it feels right, and you know exactly what you need to do. Which deals can you visualize happening? Which contacts can you see coming into your life? Which milestones can you imagine hitting in a big way?

Blending in, or being obedient, means doing the basics right. Hitting the standards for what’s expected. Turning up on time to meet your clients. Matching their dress code. Shaking hands, looking people in the eye, and remembering their names and interests. Proofreading your emails and being pleased to take clients’ calls. These are the basics that check the boxes in someone’s mind, provide the familiarity they expect, and meet the standard required for their trust. Blending in and being obedient win you a reputation for being dependable and steadfast. A solid bet, like the IBM computer or the Harvard grad. But sticking to the path of blending in as an entrepreneur will result in a stagnant journey. Every great entrepreneur has something else about them. They are remarkable. They are exceptional. They stand out.

Learn the ropes before you change them. Understand the process before you challenge it. Listen to the concerns before bringing your solutions. Approach each encounter with a beginner’s mind and be open to learning. It might take a few weeks, it might take a year, but it’s an essential stage not to skip. Without the groundwork, potentially brilliant ideas won’t be listened to, and you’ll be dismissed for not having done the basics or being unrealistic, of bulldozing in without a thorough understanding. Part of playing this game is well-placed obedience, because many people value it.

build on your foundation as soon as you can, and in many different ways. Look at the options for standing out. You could have the most ideas (which leads to having the best ideas), or you could outproduce everyone else. You could develop an outstanding online presence, blog every day, or start and complete new projects uninitiated. You could understand the clients on a new level, give more than expected, and think of everything.

You are remarkable because of what makes you stand out, not blend in. Your strengths lie in your quirks, the unique qualities that only you hold. You might not realize that because the education system, media and herd mentality try to make us uniform. Your strength is the one-of-a-kind way you write, speak or present. The eye you have for style or detail or bullshit. How calm you stay when others panic. How happy you are during doom and gloom. The way you can make someone feel special when they thought no one noticed, or heard when they felt ignored. No one can compete with you on being you. Move towards what makes you different. Love it. Embrace it. Be proud of who you are without covering it up or toning it down. Know for sure you’re bringing something new, but much needed, to the world.

Because everything you do is on a scale, setting up for success means testing the edges before deciding what is the right balance for you. Rather than registering a trademark, buying a domain name, and sharing your plans for a big change, you might first journal about it and see what comes up. You might test its validity with a few people before sending a mass mailer. In how you spend your time, you might experiment with when you exercise and build up gradually, rather than committing to a fixed regime from day one.

We’re all stuck in some way in some areas of our lives. That’s where we need ideation, which is a fancy word for coming up with lots of ideas. Wild ideas. Crazy ideas. We’re going to teach you how to have more ideas than you ever thought possible.

that there are multiple great designs for your life, though you’ll still only get to live one—it is rather liberating. There is no one idea for your life. There are many lives you could live happily and productively (no matter how many years old you are), and there are lots of different paths you could take to live each of those productive, amazingly different lives. So do the math; this adds up to tons of different possible ideas you might have. And we’re going to give you the tools to generate such ideas.

Expanding your thinking improves your ability to ideate and allows for more innovation. If you work through lots of ideas, your chances of hitting on some that can be really energizing for you go up, which increases your chance of creating something that can work and that you’ll love. More ideas also equal new insights.

Designers learn to have lots of wild ideas because they know that the number one enemy of creativity is judgment. Our brains are so tightly wired to be critical, find problems, and leap to judgment that it’s a wonder any ideas ever make it out! We have to defer judgment and silence the inner critic if we want to get all our ideas out. If we don’t, we may have a few good ideas, but the majority will have been lost—silently imprisoned behind the wall of judgment our prefrontal cortex has erected to safeguard us from making mistakes or looking foolish.

Remember our motto “You Are Here,” and get ready to work with whatever level of personal creativity you think you have. We’ll build from there. Our goal is to energize and expand on your capacity for generating lots and lots of solutions to the myriad problems that come up when you are designing your life. As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.

"But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely. You know what pain is. You know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then can you say, `All right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment.'

Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won't hurt you. It will only help. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar shirt, then you can say to yourself, "All right, it's just fear, I don't have to let it control me. I see it for what it is." Same for loneliness: you let go, let the tears flow, feel it completely-but eventually be able to say, "All right, that was my moment with loneliness. I'm not afraid of feeling lonely, but now I'm going to put that loneliness aside and know that there are other emotions in the world, and I'm going to experience them as well."

Morrie observed that most of the patients there had been rejected and ignored in their lives, made to feel that they didn't exist. They also missed compassion-something the staff ran out of quickly. And many of these patients were well-off, from rich families, so their wealth did not buy them happiness or contentment. It was a lesson he never forgot.

Aging is not just decay, you know. It's growth. It's more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it." Yes, I said, but if aging were so valuable, why do people always say, "Oh, if I were young again." You never hear people say, "I wish I were sixty-five." He smiled. "You know what that reflects? Unsatisfied lives. Unfulfilled lives. Lives that haven't found meaning. Because if you've found meaning in your life, you don't want to go back. You want to go forward. You want to see more, do more. You can't wait until sixty-five. "Listen. You should know something. All younger people should know something.

"You know how I always interpreted that? These were people so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes. They were embracing material things and expecting a sort of hug back. But it never works. You can't substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship. "Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you, as I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have."

So the TV was the same old model, the car that Charlotte drove was the same old model, the dishes and the silverware and the towels-all the same. And yet the house had changed so drastically. It had filled with love and teaching and communication. It had filled with friendship and family and honesty and tears. It had filled with colleagues and students and meditation teachers and therapists and nurses and a cappella groups. It had become, in a very real way, a wealthy home, even though Morrie's bank account was rapidly depleting.

They already have something else in mind-a friend to call, a fax to send, a lover they're daydreaming about.

"I read a book the other day. It said as soon as someone dies in a hospital, they pull the sheets up over their head, and they wheel the body to some chute and push it down. They can't wait to get it out of their sight. People act as if death is contagious."

"That's what we're all looking for. A certain peace with the idea of dying. If we know, in the end, that we can ultimately have that peace with dying, then we can finally do the really hard thing." Which is? "Make peace with living." He asked to see the hibiscus plant on the ledge behind him. I cupped it in my hand and held it up near his eyes. He smiled. "It's natural to die," he said again. "The fact that we make such a big hullabaloo over it is all because we don't see ourselves as part of nature. We think because we're human we're something above nature." He smiled at the plant. "We're not. Everything that gets born, dies." He looked at me. "Do you accept that?" Yes. "All right," he whispered, "now here's the payoff. Here is how we are different from these wonderful plants and animals. "As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on-in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here."

My old professor sighed. "There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like. "In business, people negotiate to win. They negotiate to get what they want. Maybe you're too used to that. Love is different. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else's situation as you are about your own.

I look back sometimes at the person I was before I rediscovered my old professor. I want to talk to that person. I want to tell him what to look out for, what mistakes to avoid. I want to tell him to be more open, to ignore the lure of advertised values, to pay attention when your loved ones are speaking, as if it were the last time you might hear them.

I know I cannot do this. None of us can undo what we've done, or relive a life already recorded. But if Professor Morris Schwartz taught me anything at all, it was this: there is no such thing as "too late" in life. He was changing until the day he said good-bye.

Anchor problems keep us stuck because we can only see one solution—the one we already have that doesn’t work. Anchor problems are not only about our current, failed approach. They are really about the fear that, no matter what else we try, that won’t work either, and then we’ll have to admit that we’re permanently stuck—meaning we’re screwed—and we’d rather be stuck than screwed. Sometimes it is more comfortable to hold on to our familiar, failed approach to the problem than to risk a worse failure by attempting the big changes that we think will be required to eliminate it. This is a pretty common but paradoxical human behavior. Change is always uncertain, and there is no guarantee of success, no matter how hard you try. It makes sense to be fearful. The way forward is to reduce the risk (and the fear) of failure by designing a series of small prototypes to test the waters. It is okay for prototypes to fail—they are supposed to—but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future.

One of the principles of design thinking is that you want to “fail fast and fail forward,” into your next step. When you’re stuck with an anchor problem, try reframing the challenge as an exploration of possibilities (instead of trying to solve your huge problem in one miraculous leap), then decide to try a series of small, safe prototypes of the change you’d like to see happen. It should result in getting unstuck and finding a more creative approach to your problem.

Our twenties are when we have to start creating our own sense of time, our own plans about how the years ahead will unfold. It is difficult to know how to start our careers or when to start our families. It is tempting to stay distracted and keep everything at a distance. But twentysomethings who live beyond time usually aren’t happy. It’s like living in a cave where we never know what time it is or what we ought to do or why, sometimes until it is too late.

How do you get the happy ending? John Irving ought to know. One of my favorite authors, Irving writes these multigenerational epics of fiction that somehow work out in the end. How does he do it? He says, “I always begin with the last sentence; then I work my way backwards, through the plot, to where the story should begin.” That sounds like a lot of work, especially compared to the fantasy that great writers sit down and just go where the story takes them. Irving lets us know that good stories, and happy endings, are more intentional than that.

if you try to devour the history of your discipline all at once, you’ll choke. Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch.

Nick Lowe says, “You start out by rewriting your hero’s catalog.” And you don’t just steal from one of your heroes, you steal from all of them. The writer Wilson Mizner said if you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research. I once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!”

Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds. That’s what you really want—to internalize their way of looking at the world. If you just mimic the surface of somebody’s work without understanding where they are coming from, your work will never be anything more than a knockoff.

So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What’s in there that makes you different? That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own work.

The best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you’re at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, “What would make a better story?”

One key reason people do not pursue greatness is that they quickly encounter the Enemy of Greatness: the lack of a clear Meaningful Mission. When you don’t know what you really want to do, it’s pretty difficult to do it. So, Step 1 is figuring out your purpose. As Viktor Frankl, Holocaust survivor and author of Man’s Search for Meaning, said, “The first thing that gives life meaning is a project that demands your attention.”1 Apart from that, you’re simply wandering aimlessly. I’ll equip you with practical guidance on how to get clear on your mission.

If I can recommend storytelling to you for any reason at all, it would be that storytelling helps you realize that the biggest, scariest, most painful or regretful things in your head get small and surmountable when you share them with two, or three, or twenty, or three thousand people. The other reason I can recommend storytelling, and learning about it with the book you’re holding, is that we’re all disappearing — you, me, everyone we know and love. A little heavy for a foreword maybe, but when you tell stories, you do yourself a kind favor by taking a moment to write your name in the wet cement of life before you head to whatever is next.

Telling stories about your life lets people know they’re not alone; and it lets some of the people closest to you — like family and loved ones — see your life apart from the context of family and without the kind of revisionist hindsight we can sometimes fall into concerning the ones we love most. Opening your mouth, getting out of your head, and your house, so you can be fully engaged in your life and the lives of others for the night — that’s what storytelling is all about, if you ask me. Or maybe it’s just as my friend Jesse Thorn joked: “Storytelling. In case you’re not familiar with it, it’s kind of like a less-funny stand-up comedy.”

So many great people live lives absent of greatness because they live by default and not by design. They let themselves be limited by fears, anxieties, and pain from the past instead of embracing a limitless, abundant mindset. That doesn’t mean they never deal with tough stuff. Of course not. It comes to all of us in different ways. But you don’t have to run from it when it comes. You can choose to accept the challenges and face the fears—and enjoy the journey!

When people live in the darkness of fear and uncertainty, they don’t have what I call a Meaningful Mission, an underlying purpose that gives their lives a greater significance. As a result, they don’t feel freedom within or peace on their journey. They unknowingly let fear control their life decisions and shape their perceptions of what their choices might be. As a result, they feel stuck where they are, even trapped, which can cause them to feel lost or resentful and angry at themselves and others.

“We need to build more resilient people and help them to get this idea that sometimes nobody’s going to come save you but you. It starts with you. You have to be the one that gets up and starts to drive forward. There’s a level of resiliency that comes with choosing to drive forward.”10 In other words, greatness won’t happen by accident. No one ever accidentally slipped and fell into it. Dr. Jordan Peterson, a Canadian professor of psychology, even cautions parents not to make their children’s lives too easy, because doing so can cause them not to be resilient. A lack of challenges in life can actually hurt their development.

Drinking stories about the elderly are acceptable in any form, because they are rare and oftentimes hilarious.

When telling a story to an audience, we play a game with them: we pretend that we are speaking completely off the cuff. Extemporaneous storytelling, unprepared and unrehearsed. This is not usually true. While most storytellers don’t memorize their stories (and I strongly advise against it), they are prepared to tell them. They have memorized specific beats in a story. They know their beginning and ending lines. They have memorized certain laugh lines. They have a plan in place before they begin speaking.

Just put the damn words on the page as they appear in your head and on your fingertips. Ignore your inner demons.

Rule #3: You cannot allow the pen to stop moving. I say pen because, although I do almost all my writing on a keyboard, I have found that engaging in Crash & Burn with a pen tends to trigger greater creativity (and there is some science to support this claim). But if you must use a keyboard, go for it. Either way, your hand or fingers cannot stop moving. You must continue writing words even when your mind is empty. To make this happen, I use colors. When I have no other thought in my mind, I begin listing colors on the page until one of them triggers a thought or memory. For example: Red, green, blue, black, brown . . . I tell kids that brown is my favorite color, and it makes them all crazy, which makes no sense, but in truth, I have no favorite color, which makes them even crazier . . . Writing down numbers is also a popular strategy utilized by my workshop students, though I recommend that the numbers be listed in word form. For example: One, two, three, four, five . . . I have five fingers on each hand, and there are scars on five no six of them, which seems like a lot, but maybe not . . . I’ve known frequent travelers to list countries. I had a mechanic in one of my workshops list engine parts. I had a teenager in a workshop list the names of his previous girlfriends (and apparently had more than enough names to work with). It doesn’t matter what you choose. Your list of items simply needs to be long and familiar to you.

Recalling a forgotten moment from your life or suddenly seeing it as more than what you once thought can expand the boundaries of your perceived life, while filling in gaps and connecting disparate memories into a more complete picture. Stories will both fill in the holes in the mental map of your life and help you to see how expansive that map truly is. It’s priceless.

None of us can see how a mission can be accomplished at the start because our only perspective is what we have at that moment. That perspective is shaped by what we’ve experienced in the past, not by what we might experience in the future. But when we start moving forward, our perspective begins to change. Opportunities we never imagined were suddenly open to us. Connections we didn’t realize were possible open doors we didn’t even know existed. Resources we assumed were unavailable suddenly become accessible because we learn secrets we didn’t know were once hidden from us. And it all starts by having a Meaningful Mission.

A mission by definition is greater. It takes time. It requires determination and grit to achieve. It often remakes the people who are part of it into something better. And it always implies that the destination is grander or greater than any you have previously achieved. After all, if it were something you had done before and could easily do again, it wouldn’t be much of a mission.

Laurie Santos, Yale professor and host of the podcast The Happiness Lab, told me, “There is a mistaken notion that happiness is all about self-care. But what the science suggests is that happy people are really others-oriented. They’re reaching out, making social connections, and worrying about how they can help other people and other people’s welfare. That’s what seems to lead to a happy life.”9

You’re not supposed to be twenty years old and have absolutely no one in your life to call for help.

All great stories — regardless of length or depth or tone — tell the story of a five-second moment in a person’s life. Got that? Let me say it again: Every great story ever told is essentially about a five-second moment in the life of a human being, and the purpose of the story is to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible.

That is the purpose of my story. I’m trying to tell my audience that there was a time in my life when I felt alone and lost, thinking that I was facing a lifetime of solitude, only to discover how foolish and blind I was to feel that way. The rest of the story is crafted to serve that singular moment in time and only that moment. Anything in the story that doesn’t help bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible is marginalized, shaded, or removed entirely. Anything that helps bring clarity to that moment is strengthened and highlighted.

Truly. Tell a story about a real moment of meaning from your life — a five-second moment — and people will want to hear more. More good news. You’ve also found the end of your story. Your five-second moment is the most important thing that you will say. It is the purpose and pinnacle of your story. It’s the reason you opened your mouth in the first place. Therefore it must come as close to the end of your story as possible. Sometimes it will be the very last thing you say.

Simply put, the beginning of the story should be the opposite of the end. Find the opposite of your transformation, revelation, or realization, and this is where your story should start. This is what creates an arc in your story. This is how a story shows change over time. I was once this, but now I am this. I once thought this, but now I think this. I once felt this, but now I feel this.

Stories must reflect change of some kind. It need not always be positive change, and the change need not be monumental. In fact, stories about failure, embarrassment, and shame are fantastic. Stories about trying desperately to achieve a goal and failing spectacularly are beloved. Even when progress is made, the best stories often reflect incremental change. Tiny steps forward. Glacial improvement. Audiences would much rather hear about incremental, tenuous growth than about overnight success. Regardless of whether your change is infinitesimal or profound, positive or negative, your story must reflect change. You must begin and end your story in entirely different states of being. Change is key.

The easiest, most effective way of doing this is by ensuring that the beginning and the ending of your stories are opposites or as close to opposites as possible. This is not the case in every story that I tell, but it’s true for most. I was once hopeful, but now I am not. I was once lost, but now I am found. I was once happy, but now I am sad. I was once uncertain, but now I know. I was once angry, but now I am grateful. I was once afraid, but now I am fearless. I once believed, but now I don’t. This change is what makes stories satisfying. It’s how storytellers are able to move an audience emotionally. The same holds true for most movies.

I also believe that great storytellers know this: The first idea is rarely the best idea. It may be the most convenient idea. The easiest to remember. The one you personally like the most. But rarely is the first idea the one that I choose. First ideas are for the lazy. The complacent. The easily satisfied. I fight for my beginnings. I struggle to find the correct entry point to a story, and I believe that every story has a perfect entry point. The ideal place to start. More than half of the time I spend crafting stories is spent searching for the right beginning. Once I’ve found it, the rest of the story often flows easily. The correct beginning makes the rest of the choices seem much more obvious.

I also try to start my story as close to the end as possible (a rule Kurt Vonnegut followed when writing short stories). I want my stories to be as temporally limited as possible.

If you’ve also found the right place to begin your story — a place that represents the opposite of your five-second moment, and one as close to the ending as possible — you’ve established a clear frame and arc in your story. You’ve identified the direction your story is headed in, and you and your audience probably have a good sense of where that may be. You are already going to be well received by audiences big and small. If you’re careful about choosing that opening scene — not simply choosing the first thing that comes to mind but instead asking yourself what the opening scene needs — and you open your story with story and not any form of unnecessary or qualifying introduction, you are going to grab your audience’s attention right off the bat.

Stakes are the reason we ride roller-coasters. They are why we climb trees and arm wrestle or race our friends across the backyard. Stakes are why sports dominate our culture and why asking a girl on a date can be so difficult.

Elephants can also change color. That is, the need, want, problem, peril, or mystery stated in the beginning of the story can change along the way. You may be offered one expectation only to have it pulled away in favor of another.

This method of storytelling is especially effective when the end of your story is heavy, emotional, sorrowful, or heartrending. To keep an entire story from being filled with weight and emotion, I try to find a way to make the beginning light and fun, hilarious and joyous. I present an Elephant that is happy, adventurous, and amusing to contrast with the weight, the sadness, and the solemnity at the end. Start with a pink, polka-dotted Elephant and end with varying shades of blue.

A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing the audience’s anticipation about a coming event. It’s when a storyteller loads up the audience with all the storyteller’s hopes and fears in that moment before moving the story forward. It’s an attempt to do two things: 1.​Make the audience wonder what will happen next. 2.​Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the moment about to be described. The first goal is fairly easy to achieve if a Backpack is used properly. If you can accomplish the second goal, that is really something.

It’s an odd thing: The audience wants characters (or storytellers) to succeed, but they don’t really want characters to succeed. It’s struggle and strife that make stories great. They want to see their characters ultimately triumph, but they want suffering first. They don’t want anything to be easy.

There is never room for needless complexity in a story. Remember that stories are like rivers (not unlike the river I dammed up to empty the Basin). They continue to flow even as your audience struggles to understand a time line or attempts to construct a complicated mental map in their minds. For this reason, simplicity should be prized at all points. Compression can often be helpful in this regard.

Storytellers use assumption when there is a detail so important to the story that it must be stated with specificity, so the storyteller makes a reasonable assumption about what the specifics may be. This does not mean that a storyteller should assume all details. It is only when the forgotten detail is critical to the story that an assumption should be made.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas, an Indian actress, model, singer, and winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, is someone who realizes it is futile to try to avoid failure. “When you want to create a legacy,” she told me, “it’s what you do after failure that matters.”18 As she describes it, when you first attempt something new, failures are inevitable, but if you never try anything new, you’ll never evolve, and that is a much greater risk. When you make a habit of trying new things, you diversify, increasing your chances of success. If you only stick with what you know, you put your fate in only a few skills and opportunities. And I love this powerful point she makes: Every successful person has failed along the way to their success, so why should you be any different?

These moments come when someone has a small backslide from a healthy direction, which can tempt them to totally abandon their greater goal. For example, someone might set a goal to consume a total of 1,500 calories a day. They might meet that goal Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, but then Thursday morning—donuts at the office. Then the small failure of one donut cascades into pizza and potato chips for dinner the rest of the week, because “what the hell, I’ve already failed.”22

This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on. You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money. Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.

But there’s only one not-so-secret formula that I know: Do good work and share it with people. It’s a two-step process. Step one, “do good work,” is incredibly hard. There are no shortcuts. Make stuff every day. Know you’re going to suck for a while. Fail. Get better. Step two, “share it with people,” was really hard up until about ten years ago or so. Now, it’s very simple: “Put your stuff on the Internet.” I tell people this, and then they ask me, “What’s the secret of the Internet?”

There is more to each of these stories than simply the laugh. Each one lands on something real. You must end your story on heart. Far too often I hear storytellers attempt to end their story on a laugh. A pun. A joke. A play on words. This is not why we listen to stories. We like to laugh; we want to laugh. But we listen to stories to be moved.

Just tell your story. All of it. Forget the strategies. Start in the wrong place and end in the long place. Ramble.

These events are happening right now for me, literally as I write this sentence, and, I hope, you feel as if they are happening in the space and time that you are occupying as you read these words.

The present tense acts like a temporal magnet, sucking you into whatever time I want you to occupy.

There’s one more benefit to the present tense: It helps you see your story. Some storytellers are able to see their stories. As they tell it, they almost relive the moments. Rather than staring into the eyes of their audience, their minds recreate a vision of the events as they unfold.

One of my primary goals in teaching storytelling is to make the world a more interesting place. If people know how to tell great stories and know the right stories to share, then the world becomes a more entertaining, connected, and meaningful place to live. I believe this with all my heart. Conversations about the weather are the antithesis of this ideal of an entertaining, connected, meaningful world. They are the death of good conversation. They are the enemy of the interesting. My humble suggestion: Avoid these conversations at all costs. Change the subject. Do not engage. Walk away if necessary. You will be the happier, and the more interesting, for it.

My suggestion is this: Find a person on your left, a person on your right, and a person dead center who likes you. These will be the people who are smiling. Nodding. Laughing. Use these three people as your guideposts. Make eye contact with them, and the people in each of those areas will feel you are attending to them as well.

By turning meaningful moments into repetitive sentences, you can sometimes strip some of the emotion from them. Often an audience’s presence will inject some (or all) of the emotion right back into the sentence, but usually to a lesser degree, making the moment more manageable.

You don’t have to live anywhere other than the place you are to start connecting with the world you want to be in. If you feel stuck somewhere, if you’re too young or too old or too broke, or if you’re somehow tied down to a place, take heart. There’s a community of people out there you can connect with. In the meantime, if you’re not into the world you live in, you can build your own world around you. (Now would be a good time to put on your headphones and cue up the Beach Boys song “In My Room.”) Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. Create your own world. Franz Kafka wrote, “It isn’t necessary that you leave home. Sit at your desk and listen. Don’t even listen, just wait. Don’t wait, be still and alone. The whole world will offer itself to you.” And Kafka was born a century before the Internet!

Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time. Inertia is the death of creativity. You have to stay in the groove. When you get out of the groove, you start to dread the work, because you know it’s going to suck for a while—it’s going to suck until you get back into the flow.

Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time. Writing a page each day doesn’t seem like much, but do it for 365 days and you have enough to fill a novel. One successful client pitch is a small victory, but a few dozen of them can get you a promotion.

“If you ask yourself ‘What’s the best thing that happened today?’ it actually forces a certain kind of cheerful retrospection that pulls up from the recent past things to write about that you wouldn’t otherwise think about. If you ask yourself ‘What happened today?’ it’s very likely that you’re going to remember the worst thing, because you’ve had to deal with it—you’ve had to rush somewhere or somebody said something mean to you—that’s what you’re going to remember. But if you ask what the best thing is, it’s going to be some particular slant of light, or some wonderful expression somebody had, or some particularly delicious salad.” —Nicholson Baker

The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now.

The world itself becomes a habit in no time at all. It seems as if in the process of growing up we lose the ability to wonder about the world. And in doing so, we lose something central--something philosophers try to restore. For somewhere inside ourselves, something tells us that life is a huge mystery. This is something we once experienced, long before we learned to think the thought.

To be more precise: Although philosophical questions concern us all, we do not all become philosophers. For various reasons most people get so caught up in everyday affairs that their astonishment at the world gets pushed into the background. (They crawl deep into the rabbit's fur, snuggle down comfortably, and stay there for the rest of their lives.) To children, the world and everything in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. It is not like that for adults. Most adults accept the world as a matter of course.

Once we have determined what a particular philosopher's project is, it is easier to follow his line of thought, since no one philosopher concerns himself with the whole of philosophy. I said his line of thought--referring to the philosopher, because this is also a story of men. Women of the past were subjugated both as females and as thinking beings, which is sad because a great deal of very important experience was lost as a result. It was not until this century that women really made their mark on the history of philosophy.

Nothing Can Come from NothingThese three Milesian philosophers all believed in the existence of a single basic substance as the source of all things. But how could one substance suddenly change into something else? We can call this the problem of change. From about 500 B.C., there was a group of philosophers in the Greek colony of Elea in Southern Italy. These "Eleatics" were interested in this question.

But Chauvelin was not the man to trouble himself about these social amenities, which he called mere incidents in his diplomatic career. He was blindly enthusiastic for the revolutionary cause, he despised all social inequalities, and he had a burning love for his own country: these three sentiments made him supremely indifferent to the snubs he received in this fog-ridden, loyalist, old-fashioned England. But, above all, Chauvelin had a purpose at heart.

Had she but turned back then, and looked out once more on to the rose-lit garden, she would have seen that which would have made her own sufferings seem but light and easy to bear—a strong man, overwhelmed with his own passion and his own despair. Pride had given way at last, obstinacy was gone: the will was powerless. He was but a man madly, blindly, passionately in love, and as soon as her light footsteps had died away within the house, he knelt down upon the terrace steps, and in the very madness of his love he kissed one by one the places where her small foot had trodden, and the stone balustrade there, where her tiny hand had rested last.

she realised that she had never ceased to love him; that deep down in her heart she had always vaguely felt that his foolish inanities, his empty laugh, his lazy nonchalance were nothing but a mask; that the real man, strong, passionate, wilful, was there still—the man she had loved, whose intensity had fascinated her, whose personality attracted her, since she always felt that behind his apparently slow wits there was a certain something, which he kept hidden from all the world, and most especially from her.

She, at least, ought to have known that he was wearing a mask, and having found that out, she should have torn it from his face, whenever they were alone together.

And if he failed—if indeed Fate, and Chauvelin, with all the resources at his command, proved too strong for the daring plotter after all—then at least she would be there by his side, to comfort, love and cherish, to cheat death perhaps at the last by making it seem sweet, if they died both together, locked in each other's arms, with the supreme happiness of knowing that passion had responded to passion, and that all misunderstandings were at an end.

But Brogard had evidently had enough of these questionings. He did not think that it was fitting for a citizen—who was the equal of anybody—to be thus catechised by these SACRRES ARISTOS, even though they were rich English ones. It was distinctly more fitting to his newborn dignity to be as rude as possible; it was a sure sign of servility to meekly reply to civil questions. "I don't know," he said surlily. "I have said enough, VOYONS, LES ARISTOS! . . . He came to-day. He ordered supper. He went out.—He'll come back. VOILA!" And with this parting assertion of his rights as a citizen and a free man, to be as rude as he well pleased, Brogard shuffled out of the room, banging the door after him.

A group of itinerant teachers and philosophers from the Greek colonies flocked to Athens. They called themselves Sophists. The word "sophist" means a wise and informed person. In Athens, the Sophists made a living out of teaching the citizens for money. The Sophists had one characteristic in common with the natural philosophers: they were critical of the traditional mythology.

Similarly, Socrates saw his task as helping people to "give birth" to the correct insight, since real understanding must come from within. It cannot be imparted by someone else. And only the understanding that comes from within can lead to true insight.

A philosopher knows that in reality he knows very little. That is why he constantly strives to achieve true insight. Socrates was one of these rare people. He knew that he knew nothing about life and about the world. And now comes the important part: it troubled him that he knew so little. A philosopher is therefore someone who recognizes that there is a lot he does not understand, and is troubled by it. In that sense, he is still wiser than all those who brag about their knowledge of things they know nothing about. "Wisest is she who knows she does not know," I said previously. Socrates himself said, "One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing."

Plato's point is that we can never have true knowledge of anything that is in a constant state of change. We can only have opinions about things that belong to the world of the senses, tangible things. We can only have true knowledge of things that can be understood with our reason.

Plato believed that reality is divided into two regions. One region is the world of the senses, about which we can only have approximate or incomplete knowledge by using our five (approximate or incomplete) senses. In this sensory world, "everything flows" and nothing is permanent. Nothing in the sensory world is, there are only things that come to be and pass away. The other region is the world of ideas, about which we can have true knowledge by using our reason. This world of ideas cannot be perceived by the senses, but the ideas (or forms) are eternal and immutable.

According to Plato, man is a dual creature. We have a body that "flows," is inseparably bound to the world of the senses, and is subject to the same fate as everything else in this world--a soap bubble, for example. All our senses are based in the body and are consequently unreliable. But we also have an immortal soul--and this soul is the realm of reason.

Plato is describing an ideal course of life, since by no means all humans set the soul free to begin its journey back to the world of ideas. Most people cling to the sensory world's "reflections" of ideas. They see a horse--and another horse. But they never see that of which every horse is only a feeble imitation.

all natural phenomena are merely shadows of the eternal forms or ideas. But most people are content with a life among shadows. They give no thought to what is casting the shadows. They think shadows are all there are, never realizing even that they are, in fact, shadows. And thus they pay no heed to the immortality of their own soul.

Socrates, on the other hand, believed that conscience is the same for everyone. Perhaps both views were right. Even if everybody doesn't feel guilty about showing themselves naked, most people will have a bad conscience if they are really mean to someone. Still, it must be remembered that having a conscience is not the same as using it.

Stoic school of philosophy, which grew up in Athens around 300 B.C. Its founder was Zeno, who came originally from Cyprus and joined the Cynics in Athens after being shipwrecked. He used to gather his followers under a portico. The name "Stoic" comes from the Greek word for portico (stoo).

Like Heraclitus, the Stoics believed that everyone was a part of the same common sense--or "logos." They thought that each person was like a world in miniature, or "microcosmos," which is a reflection of the "macro-cosmos." This led to the thought that there exists a universal right-ness, the so-called natural law. And because this natural law was based on timeless human and universal reason, it did not alter with time and place. In this, then, the Stoics sided with Socrates against the Sophists.

When the fusion happens, the mystic feels that he is "losing himself"; he disappears into God or is lost in God in the same way that a drop of water loses itself when it merges with the sea. An Indian mystic once expressed it in this way: "When I was, God was not. When God is, I am no more." The Christian mystic Angelus Silesius (1624-1677) put it another way: Every drop becomes the sea when it flows oceanward, just as at last the soul ascends and thus becomes the Lord.

4,000 years ago, the primitive Indo-Europeans lived in areas bordering on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. From there, waves of these Indo-European tribes began to wander southeast into Iran and India, southwest to Greece, Italy, and Spain, westward through Central Europe to France and Britain, northwestward to Scandinavia and northward to Eastern Europe and Russia. Wherever they went, the Indo-Europeans assimilated with the local culture, although Indo-European languages and Indo-European religion came to play a dominant role.

In Viking times, people also believed in a special group of fertility gods (such as Niord, Freyr, and Freyja). These gods were referred to by a special collective name, vaner, a word that is related to the Latin name for the goddess of fertility, Venus. Sanskrit has the related word van/, which means "desire." There is also a clear affinity to be observed in some of the Indo-European myths. In Snorri's stories of the Old Norse gods, some of the myths are similar to the myths of India that were handed down from two to three thousand years earlier.

One could say with some truth that it was no accident that Greek philosophy originated in the Indo-European sphere of culture. Indian, Greek, and Norse mythology all have obvious leanings toward a philosophic, or "speculative," view of the world. The Indo-Europeans sought "insight" into the history of the world. We can even trace a particular word for "insight" or "knowledge" from one culture to another all over the Indo-European world. In Sanskrit it is vidya. The word is identical to the Greek word idea, which was so important in Plato's philosophy. From Latin, we have the word video, but on Roman ground the word simply means to see. For us, "I see" can mean "I understand," and in the cartoons, a light bulb can flash on above Woody Woodpecker's head when he gets a bright idea. (Not until our own day did "seeing" become synonymous with staring at the TV screen.) In English we know the words wise and wisdom--in German, wissen (to know). Norwegian has the word viten, which has the same root as the Indian word vidya, the Greek idea, and the Latin video.

750 B.C. various prophets began to come forward preaching God's wrath over Israel for not keeping his commandments. One day God would hold a Day of Judgment over Israel, they said. We call prophecies like these Doomsday prophecies.

Jesus also uses the words "Son of God," the "Kingdom of God," and "redemption." In doing this he maintains the link with the old prophets. He rides into Jerusalem and allows himself to be acclaimed by the crowds as the savior of the people, thus playing directly on the way the old kings were installed in a characteristic "throne accession ritual." He also allows himself to be anointed by the people. "The time is fulfilled," he says, and "the Kingdom of God is at hand." But here is a very important point: Jesus distinguished himself from the other "messiahs" by stating clearly that he was not a military or political rebel. His mission was much greater. He preached salvation and God's forgiveness for everyone. To the people he met on his way he said "Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."

Socrates, we saw how dangerous it could be to appeal to people's reason. With Jesus we see how dangerous it can be to demand unconditional brotherly love and unconditional forgiveness. Even in the world of today we can see how mighty powers can come apart at the seams when confronted with simple demands for peace, love, food for the poor, and amnesty for the enemies of the state. You may recall how incensed Plato was that the most righteous man in Athens had to forfeit his life.

Jewish point of view there was no question of the "immortality of the soul" or any form of "transmigration"; that was a Greek--and therefore an Indo-European--thought. According to Christianity there is nothing in man--no "soul," for example-- that is in itself immortal. Although the Christian Church believes in the "resurrection of the body and eternal life," it is by God's miracle that we are saved from death and "damnation." It is neither through our own merit nor through any natural--or innate--ability.

But Paul nevertheless finds some common ground in this culture. He emphasizes that the search for God is natural to all men. This was not new to the Greeks. But what was new in Paul's preaching is that God has also revealed himself to mankind and has in truth reached out to them. So he is no longer a "philosophic God" that people can approach with their understanding.

330 Constantine the Great moved the capital of the Empire from Rome to Constantinople, the city he had founded at the approach to the Black Sea. Many people considered the new city the "second Rome." In 395 the Roman Empire was divided in two--a Western Empire with Rome as its center, and an Eastern Empire with the new city of Constantinople as its capital. Rome was plundered by bar-barians in 410, and in 476 the whole of the Western Empire was destroyed. The Eastern Empire continued to exist as a state right up until 1453 when the Turks conquered Constantinople."

Shortly thereafter, Spain also became part of the world of Islamic culture. Islam adopted Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Bagdad as holy cities. From the point of view of cultural history, it is interesting to note that the Arabs also took over the ancient Hellenistic city of Alexandria. Thus much of the old Greek science was inherited by the Arabs. All through the Middle Ages, the Arabs were predominant hi sciences such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, and medicine. Nowadays we still use Arabic figures. In a number of areas Arabic culture was superior to Christian culture."

Manichaean. The Manichaeans were a religious sect that was extremely characteristic of late antiquity. Their doctrine was half religion and half philosophy, asserting that the world consisted of a dualism of good and evil, light and darkness, spirit and matter. With his spirit, mankind could rise above the world of matter and thus prepare for the salvation of his soul. But this sharp division between good and evil gave the young Augustine no peace of mind.

One generation ages while another generation is brought forth. In the meantime history takes its course. Have you ever thought that the history of Europe is like a human life? Antiquity is like the childhood of Europe. Then come the interminable Middle Ages--Europe's schoolday. But at last comes the Renaissance; the long school-day is over. Europe comes of age in a burst of exuberance and a thirst for life.

St. Thomas Aquinas, cracks began to appear in the unifying culture of Christianity. Philosophy and science broke away more and more from the theology of the Church, thus enabling religious life to attain a freer relationship to reasoning. More people now emphasized that we cannot reach God through rationalism because God is in all ways unknowable. The important thing for a man was not to understand the divine mystery but to submit to God's will.

"Throughout the whole medieval period, the point of departure had always been God. The humanists of the Renaissance took as their point of departure man himself." "But so did the Greek philosophers." "That is precisely why we speak of a 'rebirth' of antiquity's humanism. But Renaissance humanism was to an even greater extent characterized by individualism. We are not only human beings, we are unique individuals. This idea could then lead to an almost unrestrained worship of genius. The ideal became what we call the Renaissance man, a man of universal genius embracing all aspects of life, art, and science. The new view of man also manifested itself in an interest in the human anatomy. As in ancient times, people once again began to dissect the dead to discover how the body was constructed. It was imperative both for medical science and for art. Once again it became usual for works of art to depict the nude. High time, after a thousand years of prudery. Man was bold enough to be himself again. There was no longer anything to be ashamed of."

1543 a little book was published entitled On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres. It was written by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who died on the day the book was published. Copernicus claimed that it was not the sun that moved round the earth, it was vice versa. He thought this was completely possible from the observations of the heavenly bodies that existed. The reason people had always believed that the sun went round the earth was that the earth turns on its own axis, he said. He pointed out that all observations of heavenly bodies were far easier to understand if one assumed that both the earth and the other planets circle around the sun. We call this the heliocentric world picture, which means that everything centers around the sun."

Since the time of Plato the sphere and the circle had been considered the most per-fect geometrical figures. But in the early 1600s, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler presented the results of comprehensive observations which showed that the planets move in elliptical--or oval--orbits with the sun at one focus. He also pointed out that the speed of a planet is greatest when it is closest to the sun, and that the farther a planet's orbit is from the sun the slower it moves. Not until Kepler's time was it actually stated that the earth was a planet just like other planets. Kepler also emphasized that the same physical laws apply everywhere throughout the universe."

calculating the planetary orbits he had merely applied two natural laws which Galileo had already proposed. One was the law of inertia, which Newton expressed thus: 'A body remains in its state of rest or rectilinear motion until it is compelled to change that state by a force impressed on it.' The other law had been demonstrated by Galileo on an inclined plane: When two forces work on a body simultaneously, the body will move on an elliptical path."

In art, a painting could depict an extremely luxurious lifestyle, with a little skull painted in one corner. "In many senses, the Baroque period was characterized by vanity or affectation. But at the same time a lot of people were concerned with the other side of the coin; they were concerned with the ephemeral nature of things. That is, the fact that all the beauty that surrounds us must one day perish."

Baroque period in Sweden came to an end with the murder of Gustav III.

Gustav III was also an extremely vain person who adored all French ceremony and courtesies. He also loved the theater..." "... and that was the death of him." "Yes, but the theater of the Baroque period was more than an art form. It was the most commonly employed symbol of the time."

I don't know how many times during the seventeenth century it was said that 'Life is a theater.' It was very often, anyway. The Baroque period gave birth to modern theater--with all its forms of scenery and theatrical machinery. In the theater one built up an illusion on stage--to expose ultimately that the stage play was just an illusion. The theater thus became a reflection of human life in general. The theater could show that 'pride comes before a fall,' and present a merciless portrait of human frailty."

Materialism also had many advocates in the seventeenth century. Perhaps the most influential was the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes.

'mechanic' comes from the Greek word 'mechane,' which means machine. It is remarkable that neither Hobbes nor Newton saw any contradiction between the mechanistic world picture and belief in God. But this was not the case for all eighteenth- and nineteenth-century materialists. The French physician and philosopher La Mettrie wrote a book in the eighteenth century called L 'homme machine, which means 'Man--the machine.' Just as the leg has muscles to walk with, so has the brain 'muscles' to think with. Later on, the French mathematician Laplace expressed an extreme mechanistic view with this idea: If an intelligence at a given time had known the position of all particles of matter, 'nothing would be unknown, and both future and past would lie open before their eyes.' The idea here was that everything that happens is predetermined. 'It's written in the stars' that something will happen. This view is called determinism." "So there was no such thing as free will."

Antiquity had its great system-constructors in Plato and Aristotle. The Middle Ages had St. Thomas Aquinas, who tried to build a bridge between Aristotle's philosophy and Christian theology. Then came the Renais-sance, with a welter of old and new beliefs about nature and science, God and man. Not until the seventeenth century did philosophers make any attempt to assemble the new ideas into a clarified philosophical system, and the first to attempt it was Descartes.

rather in the way Galileo wanted everything to be measured and everything immeasurable to be made measurable. Descartes believed that philosophy should go from the simple to the complex.

Descartes only meant that we all possess the idea of a perfect entity, and that inherent in that idea is the fact that this perfect entity must exist. Because a perfect entity wouldn't be perfect if it didn't exist. Neither would we possess the idea of a perfect entity if there were no perfect entity. For we are imperfect, so the idea of perfection cannot come from us. According to Descartes, the idea of God is innate, it is stamped on us from birth 'like the artisan's mark stamped on his product.' "

Descartes now maintains that there are two different forms of reality--or two 'substances.' One substance is thought, or the 'mind,' the other is extension, or matter. The mind is purely conscious, it takes up no room in space and can therefore not be subdivided into smaller parts. Matter, however, is purely extension, it takes up room in space and can therefore always be subdivided into smaller and smaller parts-- but it has no consciousness. Descartes maintained that both substances originate from God, because only God himself exists independently of anything else. But al-though both thought and extension come from God, the two substances have no contact with each other. Thought is quite independent of matter, and conversely, the material processes are quite independent of thought."

Descartes believed that reality consisted of two completely separate substances, namely thought and extension." "How could I have forgotten it?" "The word 'substance' can be interpreted as 'that which something consists of,' or that which something basically is or can be reduced to. Descartes operated then with two of these substances. Everything was either thought or extension. "However, Spinoza rejected this split. He believed that there was only one substance. Everything that exists can be reduced to one single reality which he simply called Substance. At times he calls it God or nature. Thus Spinoza does not have the dualistic view of reality that Descartes had. We say he is a monist. That is, he reduces nature and the condition of all things to one single substance."

The same applies to us humans. We can be hindered in our development and our personal growth by political conditions, for instance. Outer circumstances can constrain us. Only when we are free to develop our innate abilities can we live as free beings.

"Spinoza emphasizes that there is only one being which is totally and utterly 'its own cause' and can act with complete freedom. Only God or nature is the expression of such a free and 'nonaccidental' process.

"Spinoza said that it was our passions--such as ambition and lust--which prevent us from achieving true happiness and harmony, but that if we recognize that everything happens from necessity, we can achieve an intuitive understanding of nature as a whole. We can come to realize with crystal clarity that everything is related, even that everything is One. The goal is to comprehend everything that exists in an all-embracing perception. Only then will we achieve true happiness and contentment. This was what Spinoza called seeing everything 'sub specie aeternitatis.'

The most important empiricists--or philosophers of experience--were Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, and all three were British. The leading rationalists in the seventeenth century were Descartes, who was French; Spinoza, who was Dutch; and Leibniz, who was German. So we usually make a distinction between British empiricism and Continental rationalism."

"The first was the Englishman John Locke, who lived from 1632 to 1704. His main work was the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690. In it he tried to clarify two questions. First, where we get our ideas from, and secondly, whether we can rely on what our senses tell us."

"We'll take these questions one at a time. Locke's claim is that all our thoughts and ideas issue from that which we have taken in through the senses. Before we perceive anything, the mind is a 'tabula rasa'--or an empty slate."

The single sense ideas are worked on by thinking, reasoning, believing, and doubting, thus giving rise to what he calls reflection. So he distinguished between 'sensation' and 'reflection.' The mind is not merely a passive receiver. It classifies and processes all sensations as they come streaming in. And this is just where one must be on guard." "On guard?" "Locke emphasized that the only things we can perceive are simple sensations. When I eat an apple, for example, I do not sense the whole apple in one single sensation. In actual fact I receive a whole series of simple sensations--such as that something is green, smells fresh, and tastes juicy and sharp. Only after I have eaten an apple many times do I think: Now I am eating an 'apple.' As Locke would say, we have formed a complex idea of an 'apple.'

"This division of power originated from the French Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu. Locke had first and foremost emphasized that the legislative and the executive power must be separated if tyranny was to be avoided. He lived at the time of Louis XIV, who had assembled all power in his own hands. 'I am the State,' he said. We say he was an 'absolute' ruler. Nowadays we would call Louis XIV's rule lawless and arbitrary. Locke's view was that to ensure a legal State, the people's representatives must make the laws and the king or the government must apply them."

"Well, to start with, all the philosophers you have talked about are men. And men seem to live in a world of their own. I am more interested in the real world, where there are flowers and animals and children that are born and grow up. Your philosophers are always talking about 'man' and 'humans,' and now here's another treatise on 'human nature.' It's as if this 'human' is a middle-aged man. I mean, life begins with pregnancy and birth, and I've heard nothing about diapers or crying babies so far. And hardly anything about love and friendship."

You must know however, that people will start avoiding you because they too have knees that pain them and heads which hurt and they don’t want to know about yours. But think of it this way, if people avoid you, you will have more time to meditate and do fine research on a cure for whatever truly afflicts you.

"Because I would know better than the child how unnatural it was." "And why wouldn't the child think it was unnatural?" "Because it hasn't yet learned how nature behaves."

The human heart is so delicate and sensitive that it always needs some tangible encouragement to prevent it from faltering in its labor. The human heart is so robust, so tough, that once encouraged it beats its rhythm with a loud unswerving insistency. One thing that encourages the heart is music. Throughout the ages we have created songs to grow on and to live by. We Americans have created music to embolden the hearts and inspire the spirit of people all over the world.

When I find myself filling with rage over the loss of a beloved, I try as soon as possible to remember that my concerns and questions should be focused on what I learned or what I have yet to learn from my departed love. What legacy was left which can help me in the art of living a good life? Did I learn to be kinder, To be more patient, And more generous, More loving, More ready to laugh, And more easy to accept honest tears? If I accept those legacies of my departed beloveds, I am able to say, Thank You to them for their love and Thank You to God for their lives.

The feeling of getting an email! As if the ghost of a passenger pigeon had flown into your home and delivered it directly into your head, so swooping and unexpected and feathered was the feeling. How suddenly full you felt of white vapor. How you set your fingers on the keyboard to write back, and your fingers disappeared almost up to the first knuckle in those clattering beige keys—so much more satisfying than the shallow keys that came later, or the touchscreens that came even after that. The story of any courtship is one of ephemera, dead vehicles, outdated technology. Name cards, canoes, pagers. The roller rink, telegrams, mixtapes. Radio dedications. The drive-in. Hotmail dot com.

Empedocles wrote that the eye was fire set in a lantern, which poured out to illuminate mountains and forests and the face of the beloved. Other Greek philosophers believed sight was water. Either way, it was an element, capable of flaming or flooding if it was let loose from its delicate pen, of sending mountains and forests and the face of the beloved up in smoke, or else surging them away till they were gone.

the most fun you could have with intelligent, studious men was teasing them. It was as easy as eating the apple. They were eternally deep in the writing of some paper. They adjusted their glasses and sat with one leg crossed over the other and made finicking movements with their fingers, as if they were playing small pianos. “Actually,” they told me, “actually . . .” What else could I do but tease them? I had no real power; it was men like these who were in charge of my life. If they decided tomorrow I had to cover my hair or wear skirts or pray separately, or be barred from reading certain books, or take certain pills and not take others, or be silent in the presence of men, I would have to do it. To have that bald dynamic of power on display in your home every day, pretending to arch over and protect you—it does something to a person. The seminarian calls women the “tabernacle of life.” The tabernacle, if you do not know, is an ornamental box that is largely important for what it holds. It is shut up and locked when the men go away, so the consecrated elements inside cannot be stolen.

There is something about an acceptance. It makes the blood and the brain effervesce; it climbs the ladder of the happiness you felt in the heat of the work. There is no jolt like it, except the one you would experience in grade school, when just after lunchtime your English teacher would say, “Today in class we will be writing a story.” And your fingertips would turn to glad ice, and the bottoms of your feet would thrill, and the bologna sandwich in your stomach would flip over, because she was speaking directly to you. If I am ever medically dead, try whispering that in my ear and see if I don’t sit up again gasping, ready all over as the tip of a pen. Today we will be writing a story.

“I can see right through you,” my father used to tell me when I was little, and the cringe of that feeling, of being transparent to God and everyone, was so strong that I swore off all forms of autobiography for a long time. How could I be sure I was telling the truth about myself when he claimed to know me better than I did? How could I state anything with absolute certainty—whether I liked a particular song, or wanted to get up and go for a walk, or even whether I was hungry or thirsty? The only time I didn’t feel like a liar was when people asked me what I did and I told them that I wrote, and then I became a great ivy-wrapped I, just as I would have been in the illuminated manuscript.

I miss the walking and the sherbet-bright azaleas and the ghost tours outside my window just at dusk, and I miss working in that lusciously monastic room with five windows. Above all I miss the food: split biscuits with honey, coarse ribbed greens cooked with pork, ornate gold fried chicken, sweet potato casserole and brisket sliced against the grain, oysters so creamy they tasted like the absolute center of the sea. And the ocean so close, and the sun buttering the blankness of my mind, and my hands unknotting knots in the warm, uncomplicating water.

I have three words for you: father, son, and Holy Spirit. Foremost among his favorites is the original Star Wars trilogy, which he fervently believes is about priests in space, and the first three Alien films, which he believes are about how all women are destined to be mothers. Currently he is obsessed with the Transformers movies, because the greatest Transformer of all . . . is Jesus Christ. He even sat me down one day to have a serious discussion about “moral choices the Transformers are forced to make.” At no point did I interrupt him to say, “But Dad, they’re cars.” This means I am becoming an adult. Because truly, the Transformers are more than cars. Some of them are trucks.

Most people who went off the high dive were in love. The teen boys, especially, stared moodily out at some indistinct point in the crowd and then cannonballed down as if to obliterate themselves. The ones who were the most in love were the ones who yelled things like “HEY, KEVIN, YOU GAYWAD!” across the pool. They closed their eyes and thought of some untouchable classmate and plunged right into the center of the earth, which was molten. I was not in love; I had no business going off the high dive.

Deer were the pacifists of the animal kingdom. They sat around doing weeds all day and didn’t even try to get jobs. The males of the species pranced and ate salad and had a hundred kids they didn’t know about. In November, a long line of them marched to the polls, leaves held delicately in their mouths, each marked with the name of the Green Party candidate. A deer, in short, was a peace sign made out of meat, and the only way to fight it was with bullets.

Whenever he wanted to shock us, he would take off his shoe with great ceremony and reveal a toe that had been hammered absolutely flat by some misfortune. It didn’t bend at all, but stuck out at such a pure angle that Euclid would have cried in its presence. He would force us to admire it for a moment, and then tuck it back into his sock with quiet pride.

Between books, a writer feels like an angel in that idle time between missions—you are all atrophy and dimpled elbows; you are simply decorative; you are good for nothing. But when the fresh scroll is handed to you, and speed is put back into your heels, and your body re-remembers the straight line, the happiness cannot be described—not in the new book or any other. The feeling is arrowness, nothing else. Hit the apple or split the head, you are happy, you are straight ahead, you are flying.

In some dim corner I can still see those women, dressed in drab and black, moving on soundless rubber soles in and out of rooms, illuminated from above by light fixtures in the shape of dogwood blossoms.

There is something easy about singing harmony with your family—even I could do it. The sweetest part is when you come back to the home note after diverging all throughout the hymn, and you sing it in a unison that is closer than other people’s. When you come back to the home note, you are hoping to achieve complete overlap. If you sing in perfect tune your sounds will disappear into each other, and for a minute you will have no sense of your own borders. You could lose yourself forever if you did this every day, but once a year on Christmas it was all right.

I did know they were different from my father’s wine, scroll, and sky-colored windows. When I thought of being away from my own house, I thought of being in that other workshop, where the paint was still wet and everything smelled new. I could not decide whether I liked that smell better than the ancient one. I wondered if at some point I would have to choose. •

There is something I cannot stomach about those prayers for the faithful departed—they are so final, they freeze a person at the moment of their leaving.

DEATH IS ONE of those subjects where it’s worse to be glib than to be bad. When you set out to write about death, your limits are in front of you like a kind of mortality. You can go that far and no farther, and you can see nothing beyond. There is no great, grand, thunderclap ending except the thing itself.

This is what it is to write about people who are alive and then, sometimes, people who are dead. To say that his eyes were clear as agates, that his voice was a gravelly baritone, to surround him with the right adjectives and set him into the story—all this is an attempt to fit him in the glass box of a good sentence so everyone can see what he means. But it won’t work, the words can’t hold him, and I am glad. The desire to describe voice, gesture, skin color, is a desire to eat, take over, make into part of the pattern. I am happy every time to see a writer fail at this. I am happy every time to see real personhood resist our tricks. I am happy to see bodies insist that they are not shut up in this book, they are elsewhere. The tomb is empty, rejoice, he is not here.

A truce, then, between me and my father’s house. I was not made in his likeness, but I have chosen something of his same extremity, his willingness to be available for the questions that knock on the door in the middle of the night. His voice inside the verses was so sweeping, his judgment from the pulpit so black-and-white, that it was hard not to inherit them. It was hard not to inherit the desire to stand over the deceased and say something, and it was impossible, finally, not to inherit his anger. As long as I lived under his roof, I told myself that I had no temper, that I would never speak that knot of heat I felt so often in my throat, forced down into my rib cage, sent flowing into my fingertips. But I belong to myself now, and I can admit it. When I sit down at the desk, the anger radiates out of me in great bronze spikes, like holiness in the old paintings, and a sermon rises up in me as if it had been waiting for breath, and puts itself together bone to bone.

I want us to bring down the enemy of our suffering once and for all, and I want us to loot the pockets, and I want us to take baths in the blood. What do I want? I want him to have a job, and be living in your house. I want us to stop selling heaven as the home we don’t get here. I want an afterlife for my anger; I want levitation, perfection, and white wings for it, and I want an afterlife for my question, which is an answer.

People assume that the shutting-up made her smaller. But locking yourself up can be a way to shrink the castle down to your size, and to expand your body toward the wider limits of the walls, until you are rooted at the foundation, see sideways out the glass, and do your highest thinking with the smoke that leaves the chimney. And still, through the window, you can send out sweets. Emily did not show her face to the children, only the hands and arms that set down the poems. What if she wanted simply to reveal, and not to be exposed? What counts as hiding, and what counts as devoted contemplation?

Collecting was a mad instinct to own the world. If I had to go inside at all, I wanted to bring the whole outdoors with me and hold my own context in my hand. Then, when we moved to the neighborhood in St. Louis that was piece by piece being lifted into the sky, where girls were in danger and no one played after dark, the most curious thing happened: I felt the slow clank of a metal shutter coming down, being lowered by some unseen hand until there was only a stripe of light underneath, and that was the news from outside.

Sometimes, when the ceiling seems especially low and the past especially close, I think to myself, I did not make it out. I am still there in that place of diminishment, where that voice an octave deeper than mine is telling me what I am. Before I turned thirteen, I had never been part of the class that my father called empty-headed and addressed as “dollface,” that our church seemed to see as just bodies. I was simply myself, unique and irreducible. Suddenly I became female, and it was as if a telescope I had been looking through—with a clear eye, up at an unbounded night of stars—had been viciously turned on me. I went to a pinpoint. Does God exist was never a question for me then; do I exist took up the whole of my mind.

Who does a story belong to, the one I rode beside? Neither my father nor I could really claim it. It belonged to some church far off in the distance, which neither of us had ever seen. It would be installed in a stone wall, where it would glow over the good people like an agate slice. Flat faces, flat loaves, flat halos, flat savior and flat sinners, a cross section of what actually happened. Didn’t it? Couldn’t it have?

“It just seeped out of me, after I left the house. It was like forgetting a language you spoke a long time ago, when you were a child.” That is not quite right, though—I did not forget so much as turn it inside out, repurpose it, and occasionally use it to tell jokes like “Jesus is SUCH a manger babe” and “God got so many abs that he look like a corncob.” People do sometimes accuse me of blasphemy, which is understandable and which is their right. But to me, it is not blasphemy, it is my idiom. It’s my way of still participating in the language I was raised inside, which despite all renunciation will always be mine. The word “God” does not fall out of the vocabulary, as the sun does not fall out of the sky; the shapes of the stories remain, as do their revelations. I was never fluent in tongues back when it mattered, but when I am left to myself, out come all the old worshipped words, those fondled verses tumbling on verses, onto the page which can hold and forgive them.

But I did not want to be a priest. I was the same as most girls who wished themselves in a convent: I wanted to be where I could think, and where not just anyone could look at me. I wanted to sleep in a bed that was just big enough for me and my own salvation. I wanted to choose constraint and be freed by it, after constraint was all that had ever been offered to me.

repeat the same sentence that ran unbidden through my head the night my mother called him: I can only write down what you say, what you do. Please give me something, anything: a crumb of the bread that you stand in front of the people and change, a word of the absolution that flows out of you toward anyone who needs it. Forget your gold sunburst and come downstairs, I think, but whole Bibles have been written about the man who wasn’t there, who appeared for some and never others, who was thunder in a cloud. “He is who he is and that’s all he’s ever gonna be,” my mother says, picking up pieces of revenge garbage with a pair of tongs, and it sounds so much like a fresh, confused entry in the litany of names of God that I almost laugh. “He alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything that he is,” I think, and am somehow comforted. Who among us is not the great I AM? Who among us doesn’t live in a nightgown or some other bare-ass outfit at the center of his own wide sky—shining, unchanging, without beginning or end, a word in the east and a body in the west? A people who cannot change, crying out to a power who does not: please, and come downstairs, and be a human being.

Ethiopia Shall Stretch forth Her Hands to God.Think what it means that Ethiopia is Africa! All the Ethiopians in the bible were colored. It had never occurred to me, though when you read the bible it is perfectly plain if you pay attention only to the words. It is the 141 pictures in the bible that fool you. The pictures that illustrate the words. All of the people are white and so you just think all the people from the bible were white too. But really whitewhite people lived somewhere else during those times. That's why the bibie says that Jesus Christ had hair like lamb's wool. Lamb's wool is not straight, Celie. It isn't even curly.

There is a way that the men speak to women that reminds me too much of Pa. They listen just long enough to issue instructions. They don't even look at women when women are speaking. They look at the ground and bend their heads toward the ground. The women also do not "look in a man's face" as they say. To "look in a man's face" is a brazen thing to do. They look instead at his feet or his knees. And what can I say to this? Again, it is our own behavior around Pa.

It is in work that the women get to know and care about each other. It was through work that Catherine became friends with her husband's other wives. This friendship among women is something Samuel often talks about. Because the women share a husband but the husband does not share their friendships, it makes Samuel uneasy.

You should just see how they make admiration over them. Praise their smallest accomplishments. Stuff them with palm wine and sweets. No wonder the men are often childish. And a grown child is a dangerous thing, especially since, among the Olinka, the husband has life and death power over the wife. If he accuses one of his wives of witchcraft or infidelity, she can be killed.

But the children think of scarification as backward, something from their grandparents' generation, and often resist. So the carving is done by force, under the most appalling conditions.

You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason. The limits of your ambition were, thus, expected to be set forever. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity, and in as many ways as possible, that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence: you were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time on this earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do (and how you could do it) and where you could live and whom you could marry. I know your countrymen do not agree with me about this, and I hear them saying, “You exaggerate.”

It was absolutely clear that the police would whip you and take you in as long as they could get away with it, and that everyone else—housewives, taxi-drivers, elevator boys, dishwashers, bartenders, lawyers, judges, doctors, and grocers—would never, by the operation of any generous human feeling, cease to use you as an outlet for his frustrations and hostilities.

The church was very exciting. It took a long time for me to disengage myself from this excitement, and on the blindest, most visceral level, I never really have, and never will. There is no music like that music, no drama like the drama of the saints rejoicing, the sinners moaning, the tambourines racing, and all those voices coming together and crying holy unto the Lord.

It had to be recognized, after all, that I was still a schoolboy, with my schoolwork to do, and I was also expected to prepare at least one sermon a week. During what we may call my heyday, I preached much more often than that. This meant that there were hours and even whole days when I could not be interrupted—not even by my father. I had immobilized him. It took rather more time for me to realize that I had also immobilized myself, and had escaped from nothing whatever. The church was very exciting.

People, I felt, ought to love the Lord because they loved Him, and not because they were afraid of going to Hell. I was forced, reluctantly, to realize that the Bible itself had been written by men, and translated by men out of languages I could not read, and I was already, without quite admitting it to myself, terribly involved with the effort of putting words on paper.

I felt that I was committing a crime in talking about the gentle Jesus, in telling them to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life. Were only Negroes to gain this crown? Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto? Perhaps I might have been able to reconcile myself even to this if I had been able to believe that there was any loving-kindness to be found in the haven I represented.

The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality—for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical and public attitudes.

since a religion ordinarily imposes on those who have discovered the true faith the spiritual duty of liberating the infidels. This particular true faith, moreover, is more deeply concerned about the soul than it is about the body, to which fact the flesh (and the corpses) of countless infidels bears witness. It goes without saying, then, that whoever questions the authority of the true faith also contests the right of the nations that hold this faith to rule over him—contests, in short, their title to his land.

It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being (and let us not ask whether or not this is possible; I think we must believe that it is possible) must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church. If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.

For my part, the fate of the Jews, and the world’s indifference to it, frightened me very much. I could not but feel, in those sorrowful years, that this human indifference, concerning which I knew so much already, would be my portion on the day that the United States decided to murder its Negroes systematically instead of little by little and catch-as-catch-can. I was, of course, authoritatively assured that what had happened to the Jews in Germany could not happen to the Negroes in America, but I thought, bleakly, that the German Jews had probably believed similar counsellors, and, again, I could not share the white man’s vision of himself for the very good reason that white men in America do not behave toward black men the way they behave toward each other.

it is the threat of universal extinction hanging over all the world today that changes, totally and forever, the nature of reality and brings into devastating question the true meaning of man’s history. We human beings now have the power to exterminate ourselves; this seems to be the entire sum of our achievement. We have taken this journey and arrived at this place in God’s name. This, then, is the best that God (the white God) can do. If that is so, then it is time to replace Him—replace Him with what? And this void, this despair, this torment is felt everywhere in the West, from the streets of Stockholm to the churches of New Orleans and the sidewalks of Harlem.

a Negro just cannot believe that white people are treating him as they do; he does not know what he has done to merit it. And when he realizes that the treatment accorded him has nothing to do with anything he has done, that the attempt of white people to destroy him—for that is what it is—is utterly gratuitous, it is not hard for him to think of white people as devils. For the horrors of the American Negro’s life there has been almost no language. The privacy of his experience, which is only beginning to be recognized in language, and which is denied or ignored in official and popular speech—hence the Negro idiom—lends credibility to any system that pretends to clarify it.

Most Negroes cannot risk assuming that the humanity of white people is more real to them than their color. And this leads, imperceptibly but inevitably, to a state of mind in which, having long ago learned to expect the worst, one finds it very easy to believe the worst.

Protect your women: in a civilization that emasculates the male and abuses the female, and in which, moreover, the male is forced to depend on the female’s bread-winning power. Protect your women: in the teeth of the white man’s boast “We figure we’re doing you folks a favor by pumping some white blood into your kids,” and while facing the Southern shotgun and the Northern billy. Years ago, we used to say, “Yes, I’m black, goddammit, and I’m beautiful!”—in defiance, into the void. But now—now—African kings and heroes have come into the world, out of the past, the past that can now be put to the uses of power. And black has become a beautiful color—not because it is loved but because it is feared. And this urgency on the part of American Negroes is not to be forgotten

But in order to change a situation one has first to see it for what it is: in the present case, to accept the fact, whatever one does with it thereafter, that the Negro has been formed by this nation, for better or for worse, and does not belong to any other—not to Africa, and certainly not to Islam. The paradox—and a fearful paradox it is—is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere, on any continent, as long as he is unwilling to accept his past. To accept one’s past—one’s history—is not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it. An invented past can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.

The glorification of one race and the consequent debasement of another—or others—always has been and always will be a recipe for murder. There is no way around this. If one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin, there is no limit to what one will force them to endure, and, since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted, no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch. This is precisely what the Nazis attempted.

There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves. People are not, for example, terribly anxious to be equal (equal, after all, to what and to whom?) but they love the idea of being superior. And this human truth has an especially grinding force here, where identity is almost impossible to achieve and people are perpetually attempting to find their feet on the shifting sands of status. (Consider the history of labor in a country in which, spiritually speaking, there are no workers, only candidates for the hand of the boss’s daughter.) Furthermore, I have met only a very few people—and most of these were not Americans—who had any real desire to be free. Freedom is hard to bear. It can be objected that I am speaking of political freedom in spiritual terms, but the political institutions of any nation are always menaced and are ultimately controlled by the spiritual state of that nation. We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the American dream has therefore become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster. Whoever doubts this last statement has only to open his ears, his heart, his mind, to the testimony of—for example—any Cuban peasant or any Spanish poet, and ask himself what he would feel about us if he were the victim of our performance in pre-Castro Cuba or in Spain.

He didn’t dismiss magic out of hand, and he didn’t believe that fairy tales were just for children. He knew magic was real, because he’d felt it when the name of the Unseen City was stolen from his mind. And as for fairy tales, he understood that they were reflections of the people who had spun them, and were flecked with little truths—intrusions of reality into fantasy, like . . . toast crumbs on a wizard’s beard.

Spirit was the key to azoth. It was almost funny—not just that the truth had been found in a fairy tale, but that the great secret ingredient should prove so common a thing as a bodily fluid. Every alchemist who had ever lived and died in search of it had had the answer all the time, running through his very veins.

his life, time had been passing in the only way he knew time to pass: unrushed and unrushable, as sands running through an hourglass grain by grain. And if the hourglass had been real, then in the bottom and neck—the past and the present—the sands of Lazlo’s life would be as gray as his robes, as gray as his eyes, but the top—the future—would hold a brilliant storm of color: azure and cinnamon, blinding white and yellow gold and the shell pink of svytagor blood. So he hoped, so he dreamed: that, in the course of time, grain by grain, the gray would give way to the dream and the sands of his life would run bright.

Horizons instead of books. Riding instead of reading. It was a different life out here, but make no mistake: Lazlo was every bit the dreamer he had always been, if not more.

There was always, among them, such a stew of envy and longing. They hated the humans, but they also wanted to be them. They wanted to punish them, and they wanted to be embraced by them. To be accepted, honored, loved, like someone’s child. And since they couldn’t have any of it, it all took the form of spite. Anyone who has ever been excluded can understand what they felt, and no one has ever been quite so excluded as they. So they layered cynicism atop their longing, and it was something like laying laughter over the darkness—self-preservation of an uglier stripe. And thus did they harden themselves, by choosing to meet hate with hate.

The wretched thing—and the thing she never dared talk about—was that in order to exploit the humans’ fears, she’d had to dwell in them. And you couldn’t do that for four thousand nights without coming to understand, in spite of yourself, that the humans were survivors, too. The gods had been monsters, and had deserved to die. But their children didn’t. Not then, and not now.

Up in the citadel, Sarai gasped. She felt the warmth of his skin on hers. A blaze of connection—or collision, as though they had long been wandering in the same labyrinth and had finally rounded the corner that would bring them face-to-face. It was a feeling of being lost and alone and then suddenly neither.

Two warriors with their faces in their hands. Sarai, watching them, could see that everything would be better if the faces and hands were to simply . . . switch places. That is, if Azareen were to hold Eril-Fane while he held her. How anguished they both were, and how still and quiet and determined to suffer alone. From Sarai’s vantage point, she beheld two private pools of suffering so close together they were nearly adjacent—like the connecting rooms with the shut door between them. Why not open the door, and open their arms, and close them again around each other? Did they not understand how, in the strange chemistry of human emotion, his suffering and hers, mingled together, could . . . countervail each other? At least for a time.

Her father had saved his people and destroyed himself.

It choked him like weeds and rot and colonies of vermin, clogging and staining him, stagnant and fetid, so that nothing so noble as love, or—gods above—forgiveness, could ever claim space in him.

Poor Azareen. To see her curled up like that and skinned of all her armor was like seeing a heart flayed from a body, laid raw on a slab, and labeled Grief. And Eril-Fane, savior of Weep, three years’ plaything of the goddess of despair? What label for him, but Shame. And so Grief and Shame abided in adjoining rooms with the door shut between them, holding their pain in their arms instead of each other.

This was not the frustration one feels at waking from a sweet dream. It was the desolation of having found the place that fits, the one true place, and experiencing the first heady sigh of rightness before being torn away and cast back into random, lonely scatter. The place was each other, and the irony was sharp, since they couldn’t be in the same place, and had come no closer to each other in physical reality than her screaming at him across her terrace while ghosts clawed and tore at her.

The unconscious mind is open terrain—no walls or barriers, for better or worse. Thoughts and feelings are free to wander, like characters leaving their books to taste life in other stories. Terrors roam, and so do yearnings. Secrets are turned out like pockets, and old memories meet new. They dance and leave their scents on each other, like perfume transferred between lovers. Thus is meaning made. The mind builds itself like a sirrah’s nest with whatever is at hand: silk threads and stolen hair and the feathers of dead kin. The only rule is that there are no rules. In that space, Sarai went where she wanted and did as she pleased. Nothing was closed to her.

She . . . it . . . had landed on a gate, and was curved over it backward, hair streaming long, ginger blossoms raining down from it like little flames. The column of her throat was smooth cerulean, her eyes glassy and staring. Her pink slip looked lewd to her here, hiked up her bare thighs—all the more so when a crowd began to gather. And scream. An iron finial had pierced through her breastbone, right in the center of her chest. Sarai focused on that small point of red-slick iron and . . . hovered there, over the husk of her body, while the men, women, and children of Weep pointed and clutched their throats and choked out their raw and reeling screams. Such vicious noise, such contorted faces, they were barely human in their horror. She wanted to scream back at them, but they wouldn’t hear her. They couldn’t see her, not her—a trembling ghost perched on the chest of her own fresh corpse. All they saw was calamity, obscenity. Godspawn. Her moths found her, those that remained. She’d always thought they would die when she did, but some vestige of life was in them yet—the last tatters of her own, till sunrise could turn them to smoke. Frantic, they fluttered

The Zulu man is known as the warrior. He is proud. He puts his head down and fights. When the colonial armies invaded, the Zulu charged into battle with nothing but spears and shields against men with guns. The Zulu were slaughtered by the thousands, but they never stopped fighting. The Xhosa, on the other hand, pride themselves on being the thinkers. My mother is Xhosa. Nelson Mandela was Xhosa. The Xhosa waged a long war against the white man as well, but after experiencing the futility of battle against a betterarmed foe, many Xhosa chiefs took a more nimble approach. “These white people are here whether we like it or not,” they said. “Let’s see what tools they possess that can be useful to us. Instead of being resistant to English, let’s learn English. We’ll understand what the white man is saying, and we can force him to negotiate with us.” The Zulu went to war with the white man. The Xhosa played chess with the white man. For a long time neither was particularly successful, and each blamed the other for a problem neither had created. Bitterness festered. For decades those feelings were held in check by a common enemy. Then apartheid fell, Mandela walked free, and black South Africa went to war with itself

Black church was rough, I won’t lie. No air-conditioning. No lyrics up on Jumbotrons. And it lasted forever, three or four hours at least, which confused me because white church was only like an hour—in and out, thanks for coming. But at black church I would sit there for what felt like an eternity, trying to figure out why time moved so slowly. Is it possible for time to actually stop? If so, why does it stop at black church and not at white church? I eventually decided black people needed more time with Jesus because we suffered more. “I’m here to fill up on my blessings for the week,” my mother used to say.

You’re all sluts—and tonight you’re going to learn your lesson.” He sped off. He was driving fast, and he wasn’t stopping, only slowing down to check for traffic at the intersections before speeding through. Death was never far away from anybody back then. At that point my mother could be raped. We could be killed. These were all viable options. I didn’t fully comprehend the danger we were in at the moment; I was so tired that I just wanted to sleep.

He was driving fast, and he wasn’t stopping, only slowing down to check for traffic at the intersections before speeding through. Death was never far away from anybody back then. At that point my mother could be raped. We could be killed. These were all viable options. I didn’t fully comprehend the danger we were in at the moment; I was so tired that I just wanted to sleep. Plus my mom stayed very calm. She didn’t panic, so I didn’t know to panic. She just kept trying to reason with him. “I’m sorry if we’ve upset you, bhuti. You can just let us out here—” “No.” “Really, it’s fine. We can just walk—” “No.” He raced along Oxford Road, the lanes empty, no other cars out. I was sitting closest to the minibus’s sliding door. My mother sat next to me, holding baby Andrew. She looked out the window at the passing road and then leaned over to me and whispered, “Trevor, when he slows down at the next intersection, I’m going to open the door and we’re going to jump.”

My mom kept telling him off and he kept calling her names, yelling at her from the front seat, wagging his finger in the rearview mirror and growing more and more menacing until finally he said, “That’s the problem with you Xhosa women. You’re all sluts—and tonight you’re going to learn your lesson.” He sped off. He was driving fast, and he wasn’t stopping, only slowing down to check for traffic at the intersections before speeding through. Death was never far away from anybody back then.

When we came to the next traffic light, the driver eased off the gas a bit to look around and check the road. My mother reached over, pulled the sliding door open, grabbed me, and threw me out as far as she could. Then she took Andrew, curled herself in a ball around him, and leaped out behind me. It felt like a dream until the pain hit. Bam! I smacked hard on the pavement. My mother landed right beside me and we tumbled and tumbled and rolled and rolled. I was wide awake now. I went from half asleep to What the hell?! Eventually I came to a stop and pulled myself up, completely disoriented. I looked around and saw my mother, already on her feet. She turned and looked at me and screamed. “Run!” So I ran, and she ran, and nobody ran like me and my mom.

It’s weird to explain, but I just knew what to do. It was animal instinct, learned in a world where violence was always lurking and waiting to erupt. In the townships, when the police came swooping in with their riot gear and armored cars and helicopters, I knew: Run for cover. Run and hide. I knew that as a five-year-old. Had I lived a different life, getting thrown out of a speeding minibus might have fazed me. I’d have stood there like an idiot, going, “What’s happening, Mom? Why are my legs so sore?” But there was none of that. Mom said “run,” and I ran. Like the gazelle runs from the lion, I ran. The men stopped the minibus and got out and tried to chase us, but they didn’t stand a chance. We smoked them. I think they were in shock. I still remember glancing back and seeing them give up with a look of utter bewilderment on their faces. What just happened? Who’d have thought a woman with two small children could run so fast? They didn’t know they were dealing with the reigning champs of the Maryvale College sports day. We kept going and going until we made it to a twenty-four-hour petrol station and called the police. By then the men were long gone.

I still didn’t know why any of this had happened; I’d been running on pure adrenaline. Once we stopped running I realized how much pain I was in. I looked down, and the skin on my arms was scraped and torn. I was cut up and bleeding all over. Mom was, too.

And on and on and there we were, back at it, arguing about God’s will. Finally I said, “Look, Mom. I know you love Jesus, but maybe next week you could ask him to meet us at our house. Because this really wasn’t a fun night.” She broke out in a huge smile and started laughing. I started laughing, too, and we stood there, this little boy and his mom, our arms and legs covered in blood and dirt, laughing together through the pain in the light of a petrol station on the side of the road in the middle of the night.

Apartheid was perfect racism. It took centuries to develop, starting all the way back in 1652 when the Dutch East India Company landed at the Cape of Good Hope and established a trading colony, Kaapstad, later known as Cape Town, a rest stop for ships traveling between Europe and India.

The British abolished slavery in name but kept it in practice. They did so because, in the mid-1800s, in what had been written off as a near-worthless way station on the route to the Far East, a few lucky capitalists stumbled upon the richest gold and diamond reserves in the world, and an endless supply of expendable bodies was needed to go in the ground and get it all out.

As the British Empire fell, the Afrikaner rose up to claim South Africa as his rightful inheritance. To maintain power in the face of the country’s rising and restless black majority, the government realized they needed a newer and more robust set of tools. They set up a formal commission to go out and study institutionalized racism all over the world. They went to Australia. They went to the Netherlands. They went to America. They saw what worked, what didn’t. Then they came back and published a report, and the government used that knowledge to build the most advanced system of racial oppression known to man.

In any society built on institutionalized racism, race-mixing doesn’t merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. Race-mixing proves that races can mix—and in a lot of cases, want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason.

Unlike in America, where anyone with one drop of black blood automatically became black, in South Africa mixed people came to be classified as their own separate group, neither black nor white but what we call “colored.” Colored people, black people, white people, and Indian people were forced to register their race with the government. Based on those classifications, millions of people were uprooted and relocated.

If you ask my mother whether she ever considered the ramifications of having a mixed child under apartheid, she will say no. She wanted to do something, figured out a way to do it, and then she did it. She had a level of fearlessness that you have to possess to take on something like she did. If you stop to consider the ramifications, you’ll never do anything.

Under apartheid, if you were a black man you worked on a farm or in a factory or in a mine. If you were a black woman, you worked in a factory or as a maid. Those were pretty much your only options. My mother didn’t want to work in a factory. She was a horrible cook and never would have stood for some white lady telling her what to do all day. So, true to her nature, she found an option that was not among the ones presented to her: She took a secretarial course, a typing class. At the time, a black woman learning how to type was like a blind person learning how to drive. It’s an admirable effort, but you’re unlikely to ever be called upon to execute the task. By law, white-collar jobs and skilled-labor jobs were reserved for whites. Black people didn’t work in offices. My mom, however, was a rebel, and, fortunately for her, her rebellion came along at the right moment. In the early 1980s, the South African government began making minor reforms in an attempt to quell international protest over the atrocities and human rights abuses of apartheid. Among those reforms was the token hiring of black workers in low-level white-collar jobs. Like typists. Through an employment agency she got a job as a secretary at ICI, a multinational pharmaceutical company in Braamfontein, a suburb of Johannesburg.

The ultimate goal of apartheid was to make South Africa a white country, with every black person stripped of his or her citizenship and relocated to live in the homelands, the Bantustans, semi-sovereign black territories that were in reality puppet states of the government in Pretoria. But this so-called white country could not function without black labor to produce its wealth, which meant black people had to be allowed to live near white areas in the townships, government-planned ghettos built to house black workers, like Soweto. The township was where you lived, but your status as a laborer was the only thing that permitted you to stay there. If your papers were revoked for any reason, you could be deported back to the homelands.

They also introduced her to white men who were willing to rent out flats in town. A lot of these men were foreigners, Germans and Portuguese who didn’t care about the law and were happy to sign a lease giving a prostitute a place to live and work in exchange for a steady piece on the side. My mom wasn’t interested in any such arrangement, but thanks to her job she did have money to pay rent.

Hillbrow at the time was the Greenwich Village of South Africa. It was a thriving scene, cosmopolitan and liberal. There were galleries and underground theaters where artists and performers dared to speak up and criticize the government in front of integrated crowds. There were restaurants and nightclubs, a lot of them foreign-owned, that served a mixed clientele, black people who hated the status quo and white people who simply thought it ridiculous.

“Wathint’Abafazi Wathint’imbokodo!” was the chant they would rally to during the freedom struggle. “When you strike a woman, you strike a rock.” As a nation, we recognized the power of women, but in the home they were expected to submit and obey.

My grandmother always told me that she loved my prayers. She believed my prayers were more powerful, because I prayed in English. Everyone knows that Jesus, who’s white, speaks English. The Bible is in English. Yes, the Bible was not written in English, but the Bible came to South Africa in English so to us it’s in English. Which made my prayers the best prayers because English prayers get answered first. How do we know this? Look at white people. Clearly they’re getting through to the right person. Add to that Matthew 19:14. “Suffer little children to come unto me,” Jesus said, “for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” So if a child is praying in English? To White Jesus? That’s a powerful combination right there. Whenever I prayed, my grandmother would say, “That prayer is going to get answered. I can feel it.”

The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it’s easily tricked.

My mother never referred to my dad as white or to me as mixed. So when the other kids in Soweto called me “white,” even though I was light brown, I just thought they had their colors mixed up, like they hadn’t learned them properly. “Ah, yes, my friend. You’ve confused aqua with turquoise. I can see how you made that mistake. You’re not the first.”

My mom made sure English was the first language I spoke. If you’re black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. English is the language of money. English comprehension is equated with intelligence. If you’re looking for a job, English is the difference between getting the job or staying unemployed. If you’re standing in the dock, English is the difference between getting off with a fine or going to prison.

Living with my mom, I saw how she used language to cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world. We were in a shop once, and the shopkeeper, right in front of us, turned to his security guard and said, in Afrikaans, “Volg daai swartes, netnou steel hulle iets.” “Follow those blacks in case they steal something.” My mother turned around and said, in beautiful, fluent Afrikaans, “Hoekom volg jy nie daai swartes sodat jy hulle kan help kry waarna hulle soek nie?” “Why don’t you follow these blacks so you can help them find what they’re looking for?” “Ag, jammer!” he said, apologizing in Afrikaans. Then—and this was the funny thing—he didn’t apologize for being racist; he merely apologized for aiming his racism at us. “Oh, I’m so sorry,” he said. “I thought you were like the other blacks. You know how they love to steal.” I learned to use language like my mother did. I would simulcast—give you the program in your own tongue. I’d get suspicious looks from people just walking down the street. “Where are you from?” they’d ask. I’d reply in whatever language they’d addressed me in, using the same accent that they used. There would be a brief moment of confusion, and then the suspicious look would disappear. “Oh, okay. I thought you were a stranger. We’re good then.” It became a tool that served me my whole life.

They were ready to do me violent harm, until they felt we were part of the same tribe, and then we were cool. That, and so many other smaller incidents in my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. I became a chameleon. My color didn’t change, but I could change your perception of my color. If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn’t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you.

But the real world doesn’t go away. Racism exists. People are getting hurt, and just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening. And at some point, you have to choose. Black or white. Pick a side. You can try to hide from it. You can say, “Oh, I don’t pick sides,” but at some point life will force you to pick a side.

Being at H. A. Jack made me realize I was black. Before that recess I’d never had to choose, but when I was forced to choose, I chose black. The world saw me as colored, but I didn’t spend my life looking at myself. I spent my life looking at other people. I saw myself as the people around me, and the people around me were black. My cousins are black, my mom is black, my gran is black. I grew up black. Because I had a white father, because I’d been in white Sunday school, I got along with the white kids, but I didn’t belong with the white kids. I wasn’t a part of their tribe. But the black kids embraced me. “Come along,” they said. “You’re rolling with us.” With the black kids, I wasn’t constantly trying to be. With the black kids, I just was.

What happened with education in South Africa, with the mission schools and the Bantu schools, offers a neat comparison of the two groups of whites who oppressed us, the British and the Afrikaners. The difference between British racism and Afrikaner racism was that at least the British gave the natives something to aspire to. If they could learn to speak correct English and dress in proper clothes, if they could Anglicize and civilize themselves, one day they might be welcome in society. The Afrikaners never gave us that option. British racism said, “If the monkey can walk like a man and talk like a man, then perhaps he is a man.” Afrikaner racism said, “Why give a book to a monkey?” THE SECOND GIRL My mother used to tell me, “I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return.”

She was always telling me stories, giving me lessons, Bible lessons especially. She was big into Psalms. I had to read Psalms every day. She would quiz me on it. “What does the passage mean?

We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited. Growing up in Soweto, our dream was to put another room on our house. Maybe have a driveway. Maybe, someday, a cast-iron gate at the end of the driveway. Because that is all we knew. But the highest rung of what’s possible is far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her.

The only authority my mother recognized was God’s. God is love and the Bible is truth—everything else was up for debate. She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.

But I was blessed with another trait I inherited from my mother: her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don’t hold on to the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the ass-kicking that life gave you, you’ll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It’s better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You’ll have a few bruises and they’ll remind you of what happened and that’s okay. But after a while the bruises fade, and they fade for a reason—because now it’s time to get up to some shit again.

One of the most sinister things about apartheid was that it taught colored people that it was black people who were holding them back. Apartheid said that the only reason colored people couldn’t have first-class status was because black people might use coloredness to sneak past the gates to enjoy the benefits of whiteness.

As the outsider, you can retreat into a shell, be anonymous, be invisible. Or you can go the other way. You protect yourself by opening up. You don’t ask to be accepted for everything you are, just the one part of yourself that you’re willing to share. For me it was humor. I learned that even though I didn’t belong to one group, I could be a part of any group that was laughing. I’d drop in, pass out the snacks, tell a few jokes. I’d perform for them. I’d catch a bit of their conversation, learn more about their group, and then leave. I never overstayed my welcome. I wasn’t popular, but I wasn’t an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody, and at the same time I was all by myself.

I don’t regret anything I’ve ever done in life, any choice that I’ve made. But I’m consumed with regret for the things I didn’t do, the choices I didn’t make, the things I didn’t say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days.

The thing Africans don’t have that Jewish people do have is documentation. The Nazis kept meticulous records, took pictures, made films. And that’s really what it comes down to. Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them. Six million people killed. We can all look at that number and rightly be horrified. But when you read through the history of atrocities against Africans, there are no numbers, only guesses. It’s harder to be horrified by a guess. When Portugal and Belgium were plundering Angola and the Congo, they weren’t counting the black people they slaughtered. How many black people died harvesting rubber in the Congo? In the gold and diamond mines of the Transvaal? So in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History. In Africa he’s just another strongman from the history books. In all my time hanging out with Hitler, I never once asked myself, “Why is his name Hitler?” His name was Hitler because his mom named him Hitler.

And I was right there on the mic leading them along. “Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!” The whole room stopped. No one was dancing. The teachers, the chaperones, the parents, the hundreds of Jewish kids in their yarmulkes—they froze and stared aghast at us up on the stage. I was oblivious. So was Hitler. We kept going. For a good thirty seconds the only sound in the room was the beat of the music and me on the mic yelling, “Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Put your hands in the air for Hitler, yo!”

“I’ll have you know that my people stopped people like you before, and we can stop you again.” She was talking, of course, about stopping the Nazis in World War II, but that’s not what I was hearing. Jews in South Africa are just white people. All I was hearing was some white lady shouting about how white people beat us before and they’ll beat us again. I said, “You will never stop us again, lady”—and here’s where I played the trump card—“You’ll never stop us, because now we have Nelson Mandela on our side! And he told us we can do this!” “What?!” She was so confused. I’d had it. I started cussing her out. “Fuck you, lady. Fuck your program. Fuck your school. Fuck your whole people. Let’s go, guys! We’re out!” We didn’t walk out of that school. We danced out. We danced down the street pumping our fists in the air. “Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!

The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn’t discriminate.

It’s easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy enough to be removed from it. But the hood taught me that everyone has different notions of right and wrong, different definitions of what constitutes crime, and what level of crime they’re willing to participate in.

The tricky thing about the hood is that you’re always working, working, working, and you feel like something’s happening, but really nothing’s happening at all. I was out there every day from seven a.m. to seven p.m., and every day it was: How do we turn ten rand into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty? How do I turn fifty into a hundred? At the end of the day we’d spend it on food and maybe some beers, and then we’d go home and come back and it was: How do we turn ten into twenty? How do we turn twenty into fifty? It was a whole day’s work to flip that money. You had to be walking, be moving, be thinking. You had to get to a guy, find a guy, meet a guy. There were many days we’d end up back at zero, but I always felt like I’d been very productive. Hustling is to work what surfing

If you add up how much you read in a year on the Internet—tweets, Facebook posts, lists—you’ve read the equivalent of a shit ton of books, but in fact you’ve read no books in a year. When I look back on it, that’s what hustling was. It’s maximal effort put into minimal gain. It’s a hamster wheel. If I’d put all that energy into studying I’d have earned an MBA. Instead I was majoring in hustling, something no university would give me a degree

The hood was strangely comforting, but comfort can be dangerous. Comfort provides a floor but also a ceiling. In our crew, our friend G was like the rest of us, unemployed, hanging out. Then he got a job at a nice clothing store. Every morning he went to work, and the guys would tease him about going to work. We’d see him headed out all dressed up, and everyone would be laughing at him. “Oh, G, look at you in your fancy clothes!” “Oh, G, going to go see the white man today, huh?” “Oh, G, don’t forget to bring some books back from the library!” One morning, after a month of G working at the place, we were hanging out on the wall, and G came out in his slippers and his socks. He wasn’t dressed for work. “Yo, G, what’s going on? What’s up with the job?” “Oh, I don’t work there anymore.” “Why?” “They accused me of stealing something and I got fired.” And I’ll never forget thinking to myself that it felt like he did it on purpose. He sabotaged himself so that he’d get accepted back into the group again. The hood has a gravitational pull. It never leaves you behind, but it also never lets you leave. Because by making the choice to leave, you’re insulting the place that raised you and made you and never turned you away. And that place fights you back. As soon as things start going well for you in the hood, it’s time to go. Because the hood will drag you back in. It will find a way. There will be a guy who steals a thing and puts it in your car and the cops find it— something. You can’t stay. You think you can. You’ll start doing better and you’ll bring your hood friends out to a nice club, and the next thing you know somebody starts a fight and one of your friends pulls a gun and somebody’s getting shot and you’re left standing around going, “What just happened?” The hood happened.

In society, we do horrible things to one another because we don’t see the person it affects. We don’t see their face. We don’t see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don’t see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don’t live with them. It would be a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off. If we could see one another’s pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it to us to commit the crimes in the first place. As much as we needed the money, I never sold the camera. I felt too guilty, like it would be bad karma, which I know sounds stupid and it didn’t get the family their camera back, but I just couldn’t do it. That camera made me confront the fact that there were people on the other end of this thing I was doing, and what I was doing was wrong. —

We got out and everything was fine, but it rattled us. Every day we were out in the streets, hustling, trying to act as if we were in some way down with the gangs, but the truth was we were always more cheese than hood. We had created this idea of ourselves as a defense mechanism to survive in the world we were living in. Bongani and the other East Bank guys, because of where they were from, what they looked like—they just had very little hope. You’ve got two options in that situation. You take the retail job, flip burgers at McDonald’s, if you’re one of the lucky few who even gets that much. The other option is to toughen up, put up this facade. You can’t leave the hood, so you survive by the rules of the hood. I chose to live in that world, but I wasn’t from that world. If anything, I was an imposter. Day to day I was in it as much as everyone else, but the difference was that in the back of my mind I knew I had other options. I could leave. They couldn’t.

He told me his story, a South African story that was all too familiar to me: The man grows up under apartheid, working on a farm, part of what’s essentially a slave labor force. It’s a living hell but it’s at least something. He’s paid a pittance but at least he’s paid. He’s told where to be and what to do every waking minute of his day. Then apartheid ends and he doesn’t even have that anymore. He finds his way to Johannesburg, looking for work, trying to feed his children back home. But he’s lost. He has no education. He has no skills. He doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know where to be. The world has been taught to be scared of him, but the reality is that he is scared of the world because he has none of the tools necessary to cope with it. So what does he do? He takes shit. He becomes a petty thief. He’s in and out of jail. He gets lucky and finds some construction work, but then he gets laid off from that, and a few days later he’s in a shop and he sees some PlayStation games and he grabs them, but he doesn’t even know enough to know that he’s stolen something of no value.

The more time I spent in jail, the more I realized that the law isn’t rational at all. It’s a lottery. What color is your skin? How much money do you have? Who’s your lawyer? Who’s the judge? Shoplifting PlayStation games was less of an offense than driving with bad number plates. He had committed a crime, but he was no more a criminal than I was. The difference was that he didn’t have any friends or family to help him out. He couldn’t afford anything but a state attorney. He was going to go stand in the dock, unable to speak or understand English, and everyone in the courtroom was going to assume the worst of him. He was going to go to prison for a while and then be set free with the same nothing he had going in. If I had to guess, he was around thirty-five, forty years old, staring down another thirty-five, forty years of the same.

I know it looks that way, friend, but let me explain. It’s a funny story, actually. My father is white and my mother is black and race is a social construct, so…” That wasn’t going to work. Not here. All of this was happening in my head in an instant, on the fly. I was doing crazy calculations, looking at people, scanning the room, assessing the variables. If I go here, then this. If I go there, then that. My whole life was flashing before me—the playground at school, the spaza shops in Soweto, the streets of Eden Park—every time and every place I ever had to be a chameleon, navigate between groups, explain who I was. It was like the high school cafeteria, only it was the high school cafeteria from hell because if I picked the wrong table I might get beaten or stabbed or raped. I’d never been more scared in my life. But I still had to pick. Because racism exists, and you have to pick a side. You can say that you don’t pick sides, but eventually life will force you to pick a side.

It had been only a week, in a cell that wasn’t terribly uncomfortable with food that wasn’t half bad, but a week in jail is a long, long time. A week without shoelaces is a long, long time. A week with no clocks, with no sun, can feel like an eternity. The thought of anything worse, the thought of doing real time in a real prison, I couldn’t even imagine.

Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”

As headstrong and independent as my mom is, she remains the woman who gives back. She gives and gives and gives; that is her nature. She refused to be subservient to Abel at home, but she did want him to succeed as a man. If she could make their marriage a true marriage of equals, she was willing to pour herself into it completely, the same way she poured herself into her children.

After that, she never raised her hand to her children again. Unfortunately, by the time she stopped, Abel had started.

That was the turning point. When my mother started making more money and getting her independence back—that’s when we saw the dragon emerge. The drinking got worse. He grew more and more violent. It wasn’t long after coming for me in the pantry that Abel hit my mom for the second time. I can’t recall the details of it, because now it’s muddled with all the other times that came after it. I do remember that the police were called. They came out to the house this time, but again it was like a boys’ club. “Hey, guys. These women, you know how they are.” No report was made. No charges were filed. Whenever he’d hit her or come after me, my mom would find me crying afterward and take me aside. She’d give me the same talk every time. “Pray for Abel,” she’d say. “Because he doesn’t hate us. He hates himself.” To a kid this makes no sense. “Well, if he hates himself,” I’d say, “why doesn’t he kick himself?”

And he always got the second chance. The Abel who was likable and charming never went away. He had a drinking problem, but he was a nice guy. We had a family. Growing up in a home of abuse, you struggle with the notion that you can love a person you hate, or hate a person you love. It’s a strange feeling. You want to live in a world where someone is good or bad, where you either hate them or love them, but that’s not how people are.

We moved through the house as strangers, at different times. Complete silent treatment. Then one morning you’re in the kitchen and there’s a nod. “Hey.” “Hey.” Then a week later it’s “Did you see the thing on the news?” “Yeah.” Then the next week there’s a joke and a laugh. Slowly, slowly, life goes back to how it was. Six months, a year later, you do it all again.

A father does not fear retribution from his son, but I was not his son. He knew that. The analogy my mom used was that there were now two male lions in the house. “Every time he looks at you he sees your father,” she’d say. “You’re a constant reminder of another man. He hates you, and you need to leave. You need to leave before you become like him.”

After the bicycle, my mom hired contractors she knew through the real-estate business to build her a separate house in the backyard, like a little servants’ quarters, and she moved in there with Isaac. “This is the most insane thing I’ve ever seen,” I told her. “This is all I can do,” she said. “The police won’t help me. The government won’t protect me. Only my God can protect me. But what I can do is use against him the one thing that he cherishes, and that is his pride. By me living outside in a shack, everyone is going to ask him, ‘Why does your wife live in a shack outside your house?’ He’s going to have to answer that question, and no matter what he says, everyone will know that something is wrong with him. He loves to live for the world. Let the world see him for who he is. He’s a saint in the streets. He’s a devil in this house. Let him be seen for who he is.” When my mom had decided to keep Isaac, I was so close to writing her off. I couldn’t stand the pain anymore. But seeing her hit with a bicycle, living like a prisoner in her own backyard, that was the final straw for me. I was a broken person. I was done. “This thing?” I told her. “This dysfunctional thing? I won’t be a part of it. I can’t live this life with you. I refuse. You’ve made your decision. Good luck with your life. I’m going to live mine.”

So I did. I walked out. I didn’t call. I didn’t visit. Isaac came and I went, and for the life of me I could not understand why she wouldn’t do the same: leave. Just leave. Just fucking leave. I didn’t understand what she was going through. I didn’t understand domestic violence. I didn’t understand how adult relationships worked; I’d never even had a girlfriend. I didn’t understand how she could have sex with a man she hated and feared. I didn’t know how easily sex and hatred and fear can intertwine.

She never let me see us as victims. We were victims, me and my mom, Andrew and Isaac. Victims of apartheid. Victims of abuse. But I was never allowed to think that way, and I didn’t see her life that way. Cutting my father out of our lives to pacify Abel, that was her choice. Supporting Abel’s workshop was her choice. Isaac was her choice. She had the money, not him. She wasn’t dependent. So in my mind, she was the one making the decision. It is so easy, from the outside, to put the blame on the woman and say, “You just need to leave.” It’s not like my home was the only home where there was domestic abuse. It’s what I grew up around. I saw it in the streets of Soweto, on TV, in movies. Where does a woman go in a society where that is the norm? When the police won’t help her? When her own family won’t help her? Where does a woman go when she leaves one man who hits her and is just as likely to wind up with another man who hits her, maybe even worse than the first? Where does a woman go when she’s single with three kids and she lives in a society that makes her a pariah for being a manless woman? Where she’s seen as a whore for doing that? Where does she go? What does she do?

People say all the time that they’d do anything for the people they love. But would you really? Would you do anything? Would you give everything? I don’t know that a child knows that kind of selfless love. A mother, yes. A mother will clutch her children and jump from a moving car to keep them from harm. She will do it without thinking. But I don’t think the child knows how to do that, not instinctively. It’s something the child has to learn.

I laughed and grabbed his head as I had done God knows how many times before, when I was playing with him or when he had annoyed me. But this time when I touched him something happened in him and in me which made this touch different from any touch either of us had ever known. And he did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest. And I realized that my heart was beating in an awful way and that Joey was trembling against me and the light in the room was very bright and hot.

And yet—when one begins to search for the crucial, the definitive moment, the moment which changed all others, one finds oneself pressing, in great pain, through a maze of false signals and abruptly locking doors. My flight may, indeed, have begun that summer—which does not tell me where to find the germ of the dilemma which resolved itself, that summer, into flight. Of course, it is somewhere before me, locked in that reflection I am watching in the window as the night comes down outside. It is trapped in the room with me, always has been, and always will be, and it is yet more foreign to me than those foreign hills outside.

It is hard to say why. I don't know why. But it allowed all of Ellen's prophecies about me to come true. She had said that there would come a time when nothing and nobody would be able to rule me, not even my father. And that time certainly came. It was after Joey. The incident with Joey had shaken me profoundly and its effect was to make me secretive and cruel. I could not discuss what had happened to me with anyone, I could not even admit it to myself; and, while I never thought about it, it remained, nevertheless, at the bottom of my mind, as still and as awful as a decomposing corpse. And it changed, it thickened, it soured the atmosphere of my mind. Soon it was I who came staggering home late at night, it was I who found Ellen waiting up for me, Ellen and I who wrangled night in and night out.

We were not like father and son, my father sometimes proudly said, we were like buddies. I think my father sometimes actually believed this. I never did. I did not want to be his buddy; I wanted to be his son. What passed between us as masculine candor exhausted and appalled me. Fathers ought to avoid utter nakedness before their sons. I did not want to know—not, anyway, from his mouth—that his flesh was as unregenerate as my own. The knowledge did not make me feel more like his son—or buddy—it only made me feel like an interloper, and a frightened one at that. He thought we were alike. I did not want to think so. I did not want to think that my life would be like his, or that my mind would ever grow so pale, so without hard places and sharp, sheer drops. He wanted no distance between us; he wanted me to look on him as a man like myself. But I wanted the merciful distance of father and son, which would have permitted me to love him.

For I am—or I was—one of those people who pride themselves on their willpower, on their ability to make a decision and carry it through. This virtue, like most virtues, is ambiguity itself. People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception. Their decisions are not really decisions at all—a real decision makes one humble, one knows that it is at the mercy of more things than can be named—but elaborate systems of evasion, of illusion, designed to make themselves and the world appear to be what they and the world are not. This is certainly what my decision, made so long ago in Joey's bed, came to. I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened

What happened was that, all unconscious of what this ennui meant, I wearied of the motion, wearied of the joyless seas of alcohol, wearied of the blunt, bluff, hearty, and totally meaningless friendships, wearied of wandering through the forests of desperate women, wearied of the work, which fed me only in the most brutally literal sense. Perhaps, as we say in America, I wanted to find myself. This is an interesting phase, not current as far as I know in the language of any other people, which certainly does not mean what it says but betrays a nagging suspicion that something has been misplaced.

Though he wanted to trust everybody, he was incapable of trusting a living soul; to make up for this, he threw his money away on people; inevitably, then, he was abused. Then he buttoned his wallet, locked his door, and retired into that strong self-pity which was, perhaps, the only thing he had which really belonged to him.

Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don't know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it. Either, or: it takes strength to remember, it takes another kind of strength to forget, it takes a hero to do both. People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget.

two grown men jostling each other on the wide sidewalk and aiming the cherry pits, as though they were spitballs, into each other's faces, must have been outrageous. And I realized that such childishness was fantastic at my age and the happiness out of which it sprang yet more so; for that moment I really loved Giovanni, who had never seemed more beautiful than he was that afternoon. And, watching his face, I realized that it meant much to me that I could make his face so bright. I saw that I might be willing to give a great deal not to lose that power. And I felt myself flow toward him, as a river rushes when the ice breaks up. Yet, at that very moment, there passed between us on the pavement another boy, a stranger, and I invested him at once with Giovanni's beauty and what I felt for Giovanni I also felt for him. Giovanni saw this and saw my face and it made him laugh the more. I blushed and he kept laughing and then the boulevard, the light, the sound of his laughter turned into a scene from a nightmare. I kept looking at the trees, the light falling through the leaves. I felt sorrow and shame and panic and great bitterness. At the same time—it was part of my turmoil and also outside it—I felt the muscles in my neck tighten with the effort I was making not to turn my head and watch that boy diminish down the bright avenue. The beast which Giovanni had awakened in me would never go to sleep again; but one day I would not be with Giovanni anymore.

I scarcely know how to describe that room. It became, in a way, every room I had ever been in and every room I find myself in hereafter will remind me of Giovanni's room. I did not really stay there very long—we met before the spring began and I left there during the summer—but it still seems to me that I spent a lifetime there. Life in that room seemed to be occurring underwater, as I say, and it is certain that I underwent a sea change there.

Yet it was true, I recalled, turning away from the river down the long street home, I wanted children. I wanted to be inside again, with the light and safety, with my manhood unquestioned, watching my woman put my children to bed. I wanted the same bed at night and the same arms and I wanted to rise in the morning, knowing where I was. I wanted a women to be for me a steady ground, like the earth itself, where I could always be renewed. It had been so once; it had almost been so once. I could make it so again, I could make it real. It only demanded a short, hard strength for me to become myself again.

'Maybe everything bad that happens to you makes you weaker,' said Giovanni, as though he had not heard me, 'and so you can stand less and less.' Then, looking up at me, 'No. The worst thing happened to me long ago and my life has been awful since that day. You are not going to leave me, are you?'

He went to the sink and started washing his face. He combed his hair. I watched him. He grinned at me in the mirror, looking, suddenly, beautiful and happy. And young—I had never in my life before felt so helpless or so old.

'I'm beginning to see,' I said, carefully, 'that kids like Giovanni are in a difficult position. This isn't, you know, the land of opportunity—there's no provision made for them. Giovanni's poor, I mean he comes from poor folks, and there isn't really much that he can do. And for what he can do, there's terrific competition. And, at that, very little money, not enough for them to be able to think of building any kind of future. That's why so many of them wander the streets and turn into gigolos and gangsters and God knows what.'

I am nothing to you, nothing, and you bring me fever but no delight.'

turned and held him in my arms, staring above his head at the wall, at the man and woman on the wall who walked together among roses. He was sobbing, it would have been said, as though his heart would break. But I felt that it was my heart which was broken. Something had broken in me to make me so cold and so perfectly still and far away. Still, I had to speak. 'Giovanni,' I said. 'Giovanni.' He began to be still, he was listening; I felt, unwillingly, not for the first time, the cunning of the desperate. 'Giovanni,' I said, 'you always knew that I would leave one day. You knew my fiancée was coming back to Paris.' 'You are not leaving me for her,' he said. 'You are leaving me for some other reason. You lie so much, you have come to believe all your own lies. But I, I have senses. You are not leaving me for a woman. If you were really in love with this little girl, you would not have had to be so cruel to me.'

You never have loved anyone, I am sure you never willl You love your purity, you love your mirror—you are just like a little virgin, you walk around with your hands In iront of you as though you had some precious metal, gold, silver, rubies, maybe diamonds down there between your legs ! You will never give it to anybody, you will never let anybody touch it—man or woman. You want to be clean. You think you came here covered with soap and you think you will go out covered with soap—and you do not want to stink, not even for five minutes, in the meantime.' He grasped me by the collar, wrestling and caressing at once, fluid and iron at once, saliva spraying from his lips and his eyes full of tears, but with the bones of his face showing and the muscles leaping in his arms and neck. You want to leave Giovanni because he makes you stink. You want to despise Giovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love. You want to kill him in the name of all your lying little moralities. And you—you are immoral. You are, by far, the most immoral man I have met in all my life. Look, look what you have done to me. Do you think you could have done this if I did not love you? Is this what you should do to love?'

branded, his body was burned into my mind, into my dreams. And all this time he did not take his eyes from me. He seemed to find my face more transparent than a shop window. He did not smile, he was neither grave, nor vindictive, nor sad; he was still. He was waiting, I think, for me to cross that space and take him in my arms again—waiting, as one waits at a deathbed for the miracle one dare not disbelieve, which will not happen. I had to get out of there for my face showed too much, the war in my body was dragging me down.

Sōseki‘s brilliant and extremely concise use of the Japanese language makes all his writings difficult to translate. In the case of this particular book, difficulty arises with the very first word of its title, Wagahai wa Neko de Aru. There being no English equivalent for the Japanese word Wagahai, the main significance of that title, the comic incongruity of a mere cat, a mere stray mewling kitten, referring to itself in so lordly a manner, cannot be conveyed to the English reader. An additional difficulty that faces any translator of Sōseki’s work is his individual literary style: its reflection of his deep scholarship in Chinese, Japanese, and English literature, its consequent exploitation of a singularly wide range of reference and its unique combination of classical and colloquial language. Such problems usually lead translators to beg the indulgence of their readers: but forgive them not, for they know what they do.

Sometimes I tiptoe to his study for a peep and find him taking a snooze. Occasionally his mouth is drooling onto some book he has begun to read. He has a weak stomach and his skin is of a pale yellowish color, inelastic and lacking in vitality.

There are times when even I, a mere cat, can put two thoughts together. “Teachers have it easy. If you are born a human, it’s best to become a teacher. For if it’s possible to sleep this much and still to be a teacher, why, even a cat could teach.” However, according to the master, there’s nothing harder than a teacher’s life and every time his friends come round to see him, he grumbles on and on.

The Italian Master, Andrea del Sarto, remarked that if you want to paint a picture, always depict nature as she is. In the sky, there are stars. On earth, there are sparkling dews. Birds are flying. Animals are running. In a pond there are goldfish. On an old tree one sees winter crows. Nature herself is one vast living picture. D’you understand? If you want to paint a picturesque picture, why not try some preliminary sketching?”

Finally I could see the nice girl was going to end up with the nice football hero and the sexy girl was going to end up with nobody, because the man named Gil had only wanted a mistress and not a wife all along and was now packing off to Europe on a single ticket.

My mother kept telling me nobody wanted a plain English major. But an English major who knew shorthand was something else again. Everybody would want her. She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she would transcribe letter after thrilling letter. The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters. Besides, those little shorthand symbols in the book my mother showed me seemed just as bad as let t equal time and let s equal the total distance.

It might be nice to be pure and then to marry a pure man, but what if he suddenly confessed he wasn’t pure after we were married, the way Buddy Willard had? I couldn’t stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not. Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a redblooded intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who wasn’t pure either. Then when he started to make my life miserable I could make his miserable as well. When I was nineteen, pureness was the great issue. Instead of the world being divided up into Catholics and Protestants or Republicans and Democrats or white men and black men or even men and women, I saw the world divided into people who had slept with somebody and people who hadn’t, and this seemed the only really significant difference between one person and another. I thought a spectacular change would come over me the day I crossed the boundary line. I thought it would be the way I’d feel if I ever visited Europe. I’d come home, and if I looked closely into the mirror I’d be able to make out a little white Alp at the back of my eye. Now I thought that if I looked into the mirror tomorrow I’d see a doll-size Constantin sitting in my eye and smiling

When I lifted my head, the photographer had vanished. Jay Cee had vanished as well. I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a terrible animal. It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on. I fumbled in my pocketbook for the gilt compact with the mascara and the mascara brush and the eyeshadow and the three lipsticks and the side mirror. The face that peered back at me seemed to be peering from the grating of a prison cell after a prolonged beating. It looked bruised and puffy and all the wrong colors. It was a face that needed soap and water and Christian tolerance.

Quiet as a burglar in my cornflower-sprigged bathrobe, I crept to the edge of the parapet. The parapet reached almost to my shoulders, so I dragged a folding chair from the stack against the wall, opened it, and climbed onto the precarious seat. A stiff breeze lifted the hair from my head. At my feet, the city doused its lights in sleep, its buildings blackened, as if for a funeral. It was my last night. I grasped the bundle I carried and pulled at a pale tail. A strapless elasticized slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity, slumped into my hand. I waved it, like a flag of truce, once, twice....The breeze caught it, and I let go. A white flake floated out into the night, and began its slow descent. I wondered on what street or rooftop it would come to rest. I tugged at the bundle again. The wind made an effort, but failed, and a batlike shadow sank toward the roof garden of the penthouse opposite. Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly, like a loved one’s ashes, the gray scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York.

The letters grew barbs and rams’ horns. I watched them separate, each from the other, and jiggle up and down in a silly way. Then they associated themselves in fantastic, untranslatable shapes, like Arabic or Chinese. I decided to junk my thesis. I decided to junk the whole honors program and become an ordinary English major. I went to look up the requirements of an ordinary English major at my college.

At the foot of the stone I arranged the rainy armful of azaleas I had picked from a bush at the gateway of the graveyard. Then my legs folded under me, and I sat down in the sopping grass. I couldn’t understand why I was crying so hard. Then I remembered that I had never cried for my father’s death. My mother hadn’t cried either. She had just smiled and said what a merciful thing it was for him he had died, because if he had lived he would have been crippled and an invalid for life, and he couldn’t have stood that, he would rather have died than had that happen. I laid my face to the smooth face of the marble and howled my loss into the cold salt rain.

Reis suggests creating shorter feedback loops throughout product development and inviting ‘early adopters’ to come on board during that process to provide real-time feedback on any problems they’re having or features which are missing

Tey have no idea how you deliver your goods and/or how much the time you take to deliver your goods and services relates to their cost.

Prospects may think they know what you do.However, I can guarantee they have no idea about what your products do, how you work, or how your systems and processes work. Tey have no idea how you deliver your goods and/or how much the time you take to deliver your goods and services relates to their cost. Most of all they have no idea whether your product or service is right for them or what the outcome of using your product or service will produce for them. To overcome this, you have to create something called a ‘customer journey’.

During the frst ffeen minutes of their conversation, the sales rep didn’t once ask any questions about the hotel, the hotel manager or their objectives. Teir meeting ended with a, “No! Not now, thank you. ” I wonder, had the sales exec asked more questions, whether the hotel manager would have liked and trusted the sales exec more? Remember, your prospects have absolutely no idea about your systems, processes, or outcomes your products and services produce. Which is why a commitment is imperative. Te contract means that your prospect is committing to your system or process. Even if they don’t fully understand it, their brain is telling them to ‘trust the process’

You will start to realise that business is just a game. I say a game because games are fun and business is fun when you make it fun. Games have rules that every player must abide by. Your success is defned when your work is your passion; you create the rule book for your business. It’s not defned by how much work you do to make the business function. My challenge to those watching this video is to go away now and map out your perfect customer journey. Draw it like a fow diagram, so you can see each of the steps your customers take along the way.

Michael’s tip number three; remember this is not about you, it’s about your audience. If you’re nervous and thinking about yourself, you’re not going to deliver a brilliant talk.

Having thus expressed his admiration, I thought he had finished with the matter. But no, he continued studying it, first sideways and then longways. In order to examine the object he twists his body, then stretches out his arms like an ancient studying the Book of Divinations and then, turning to face the window, he brings it in to the tip of his nose.

Humans appear to think that cows and horses are constructed from rejected human material, and that cats are constructed from cow pats and horse dung. Such thoughts, objectively regarded, are in very poor taste though they are no doubt not uncommon among teachers who, ignorant even of their ignorance, remain self-satisfied with their quaint puffed-up ideas of their own unreal importance. Even cats must not be treated roughly or taken for granted. To the casual observer it may appear that all cats are the same, facsimiles in form and substance, as indistinguishable as peas in a pod; and that no cat can lay claim to individuality. But once admitted to feline society, that casual observer would very quickly realize that things are not so simple, and that the human saying that “people are freaks” is equally true in the world of cats.

Our eyes, noses, fur, paws—all of them differ. From the tilt of one’s whiskers to the set of one’s ears, down to the very hang of one’s tail, we cats are sharply differentiated. In our good looks and our poor looks, in our likes and dislikes, in our refinement and our coarsenesses, one may fairly say that cats occur in infinite variety. Despite the fact of such obvious differentiation, humans, their eyes turned up to heaven by reason of the elevation of their minds or some such other rubbish, fail to notice even obvious differences in our external features, that our characters might be characteristic is beyond their comprehension. Which is to be pitied.

Though the rice-cakes are admittedly small, he must have eaten some six or seven before leaving the last one floating in the bowl. “I’ll stop now,” he remarked and laid his chopsticks down.

Compared with such complexities, cats are truly simple. If we want to eat, we eat; if we want to sleep, we sleep; when we are angry, we are angry utterly; when we cry, we cry with all the desperation of extreme commitment to our grief. Thus we never keep things like diaries. For what would be the point? No doubt human beings like my two-faced master find it necessary to keep diaries in order to display in a darkened room that true character so assiduously hidden from the world.

The more that humans show me sympathy, the more I am inclined to forget that I am a cat. Feeling that I am now closer to humans than to cats, the idea of rallying my own race in an effort to wrest supremacy from the bipeds no longer has the least appeal. Moreover, I have developed, indeed evolved, to such an extent that there are now times when I think of myself as just another human in the human world; which I find very encouraging. It is not that I look down on my own race, but it is no more than natural to feel most at ease among those whose attitudes are similar to one’s own.

Having thus graduated from felinity to humanity, I find myself no longer able to confine my interests to the world of Tortoiseshell and Blacky. With a haughtiness not less prideful than that of human beings, I, too, now like to judge and criticize their thoughts and words and deeds. This, surely, is equally natural.

“But, Mrs. Sneaze, my lies are merely tarrydiddles. That woman’s lies, every one of them, have hooks inside them. They’re tricky lies. Lies loaded with malice aforethought. They are the spawn of craftiness. Please never confuse such calculated monkey-minded wickedness with my heaven-sent taste for the comicality of things. Should such confusion prevail, the God of Comedy would have no choice but to weep for mankind’s lack of perspicacity.”

Such utter self-deception is, I dare say, a form of simple-mindedness, but however genuine the self-deception, if the actuality is objectionable to other people it should be put down. As I lay there thinking that there’s no real difference between our grinding skivvy and those evil-doing gentlefolk who think themselves so righteous, the night wore peacefully on.

However, considered from the feline viewpoint, the same facts lead to the opposite conclusion: that God, if not entirely impotent, is at least of limited ability, even incompetent. Certainly of no greater creative capability than muddle-headed man. God is supposed to have created, of intent, as many faces as there are people. But surely one cannot just dismiss the possibility that, in fact, he lacked sureness of touch; that, though he originally intended to create every man-jack of mankind with the same face, he found the task impossible, and that he consequently produced so long a string of botched appearances as to end up with the present disorderly state of the human physiognomy. Thus the variformity of the human face can equally well be regarded either as a demonstration of God’s success or as evidence of his failure. Lacking knowledge of his original creative intent, one can only say that the evidence of the human face argues no more strongly for God’s omnipotence than it does for his incompetence.

it is perhaps not surprising that man should get so excited about certain one-sided aspects of his limited view of reality, and, in particular, should allow himself to fall into awe of God. Any creature capable of seeing things whole must recognize that, if it is difficult to create infinite variation, it is equally difficult to create absolute similitude.

For the peculiarity was that the thief’s face was the spitting image of the handsome face of our much-loved Avalon Coldmoon. Naturally, I lack acquaintances among the burglaring fraternity, but, basing my judgment on their outrageous behaviors, I had formed my own private picture of a burglar’s face. But the face of this particular burglar did not match my image.

Two relevant sayings by ancient Chinese sages occur to my mind. “Elevated and noble music cannot penetrate the ears of the worldly wise” and “Everyone sings street-songs but very few can join in singing such learned airs as ‘Shining Spring’ and ‘White Snow.’” It’s a waste of effort to try and force those incapable of seeing more than outer forms to understand the inner brilliance of their own souls.

Inasmuch as they are born imperfect, it might be asking too much if one expected them to wear, as is the custom of cats, the same clothes all year long but, surely to goodness, they cannot need to swaddle their skins in such a heterogeneity of sheer clobber. Since it seems not to shame them to be indebted to sheep, to be dependent on silkworms, and even to accept the charity of cotton shrubs, one could almost assert that their extravagance is an admission of incompetence.

If you don’t take exercise, you will be judged incapable of taking it by reason of an inability to afford either the time or the expense, or both. It is thus no longer a simple question of not taking exercise. In olden times those who did take physical exercise, persons such as the riffraff of male servants in an upper-class household, were regarded with a proper scorn. But nowadays it is precisely those who do not take some form of physical exercise at whom the world turns up its nose. The world’s evalua-tions of an individual’s social worth, like the slits in my eyeballs, change with time and circumstance.

I hold him down in that squashed-face position whilst I take a little breather. Myself at ease again, I let the wretched perisher get up and struggle on. Then, again, I catch him. My strategy is based, of course, on the classic Chinese methods of Kung Ming, that military marvel of the Shu Kingdom in the third century, who, seven times in succession, first caught, then freed, his enemy.

Of late, however, just because some kind of parasitic insect, fleas, in fact, have taken to breeding in my fur, even my most tentative approaches to a human being evoke a gross response. I am grabbed by the scruff of the neck and pitched clean out of the room. It seems that this sudden aversion stems from human disgust with those barely visible and totally insignificant insects which I harbor. A heartless and most callous attitude! How can such inconsiderate behavior possibly be justified by the presence in my coat of one or two thousand footling fleas? The answer is, of course, that Article One of those Laws of Love (by which all human creatures regulate their lives) specifically enjoins that “ye shall love one another for so long as it serves thine individual interest.”

It is of course true that the human creature characteristically prides itself on its self-reliance. However, it would be more exact to say that the creature, knowing it can’t rely upon itself, would very much like to believe that it could and is consequently never at ease with itself until it can give a practical demonstration to some other such creature of how much it can rely upon itself.

We share these concerns. In particular, we emphatically agree that for government, the risks of mistake, bias, and overreaching are real and sometimes serious. We favor nudges over commands, requirements, and prohibitions in part for that reason. But governments, no less than cafeterias (which governments frequently run), have to provide starting points of one or another kind. This is not avoidable. As we shall emphasize, they do so every day through the rules they set, in ways that inevitably affect some choices and outcomes. In this respect, the antinudge position is unhelpful—a literal nonstarter.

“I saved for years,” she said grimly. “Bounties. Blood work. Most of it’s gone, now.” She glared balefully. “As gone as the shop and everything else. There’s almost nothing left. Less than what I started with, by leagues.” She looked at Tandri, who winced at her tone of voice. “What did you call it… Arcane Reciprocity? Well, here it is, this is the backlash.” She felt her teeth bared, her fangs huge in her jaw, her burnt and barely healing skin tight over her skull, her brain throbbing. A part of her understood that she was hurting them, wounding these people who were friends. That some older, crueler self was emerging, crawling from the wreckage of who she thought she had become. That newly ruined part of her cried out for her to stop, to let it be for now, but the crueler self was ascendant, its opponent too weakened and diminished to intervene. “It’s fucking gone,” she snarled. “I spent my chance, and I can’t earn it back.” She held Tandri’s gaze and deliberately said, “This is the part where I do what desperate people do. This is the part where I flee.” Tandri jerked as if struck. Savage satisfaction burned through Viv, followed by a wave of nausea. “Give it time,” said Cal, in his gritty, patient voice. “What fucking difference would that make?” she roared. In the next moment, Viv slumped, staring down at her hands, limp in her lap. “You should go,” she whispered hoarsely. She heard him quietly rise and leave

The woman held her gaze steadily, face composed, but eyes wet. Viv felt a warm weight in her center, and for a moment, they were enclosed again in that bubble of calm rightness they’d once shared. Then the savage, older Viv clawed her way to the fore, whispering “It’s what she is. You’ve felt this before. She keeps it hooded like a lantern until she needs it, and then she lets it loose, and you fall under her spell.” But even as that bleak thought spread through her mind like the spectral flame, it evaporated just as swiftly in the light of dawn. Tandri’s warm, pulsing aura, the one that had touched her a few fleeting times, was absent. There was no arcana, no force, no trick. No magic to it, at all. There never had been. Not even once. She saw in Tandri’s face, composed though it was, that she was awaiting some judgment. Preparing herself for it, to be struck, ignored, or accepted. And terrified of all three

so I must be a few quarts low. Right? Wrong. The reality is, we have plenty of attention. What we lack is the ability to regulate our attention. You know how lizards can’t internally regulate their body temperature? ADHD brains have difficulty regulating their focus (and emotions, and sleep, and…okay, yep, we’ll get to that later). The ability to control our focus—also called top-down attentional control—relies on the prefrontal cortex. It is the last part of the brain to develop, and it develops even more slowly in those with ADHD. And even once it is fully developed, it’s still impaired.

Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is the practice of intentionally bringing your attention back to whatever you’re doing, thinking, or feeling in the present moment in a nonjudgmental, curious way. If you are doing the dishes, you might notice how the water feels on your hands. If you are avoiding doing the dishes, you might notice the feelings that come up for you. “Huh. Interesting. Moving on.” Practicing mindfulness improves self-awareness and strengthens our ability to redirect our attention when we need to. Install some bumpers. My favorite low-tech way to do this is to create a “Doing” and “Not Doing” list on separate sticky notes. Put both lists where you can see them while you work, so you can notice if you’ve wandered off track. You can also install physical barriers. When I kept getting distracted while I was cooking, I put up a baby gate. I knew I’d forget about the pot on the stove as soon as I wandered away from the kitchen. Running into a physical barrier was an excellent reminder of what I was supposed to be doing, and brought my attention back, too. If stuff pops up, put it down on paper. If you suddenly think of something you need to do, write it down in a “parking lot” instead of acting on it right away. You can take a look at what you’ve written when you’re done working on the task at hand and see if it actually needs tending to right away. Often,

Create the right conditions for hyperfocus to happen. Different brains achieve hyperfocus in different ways, but most of us require a certain amount of dedicated time, plus an environment that is conducive to long periods of focused work. Before work, I try to avoid doing things that will get my brain spinning on something else and intentionally get my brain spinning on the task I want it to do instead.[*6] Establish a cutoff time. Just because you might be able to hyperfocus for long periods doesn’t mean it’s helpful to keep working as long as you can. Sometimes, limiting your intense focus—and having a cutoff so you can start winding down for bed, eat food, or do whatever else your body needs—can help you to be productive the next day, too. This can lead to more good brain days—and better productivity—overall. Just…make sure to set an alarm. Leave yourself “breadcrumbs.” In some situations, we know we really need to stop, but we’re afraid to stop because we’re not sure if we can get started again. When it’s time for a hyperfocus spell to come to an end, use a bit of that remaining

Take brain breaks. If you are losing mental energy but want to keep going, consider a time-limited “brain break.” Taking a walk around the block, playing a relaxing game, or just staring out the window can be the difference between continued productivity and a pooped and cranky brain. (Sleep is also a great brain break! More on this page.) Plan time away from your task. If you have a long, cognitively intense project (like studying for finals or writing a presentation), make sure you schedule to take time away from it if you can. Visit the park on your lunch break or sign up for an exercise class. Put the thing in a drawer for a week. Not only will your brain get a chance to recharge

If you have a long, cognitively intense project (like studying for finals or writing a presentation), make sure you schedule to take time away from it if you can. Visit the park on your lunch break or sign up for an exercise class. Put the thing in a drawer for a week. Not only will your brain get a chance to recharge, but time away from a stressor can also help prevent burnout

Take a break from self-reg. Many people with ADHD feel like they’re “bad at relaxing” because while they’re TRYING to relax, they end up doing something else. What I have learned is that, for us, taking a break from self-regulating IS a break. Sometimes, letting your brain do what it wants—even if that’s starting a new project—is more restful than asking it to focus on a relaxing activity

Our brains are incredible at divergent thinking, coming up with lots of ideas, new ways to combine things, and innovative ways to solve problems. This is why many of us are inventors, early tech adopters, industry leaders, and disrupters. And in the relentless pursuit of improving our ability to focus, we might forget to allow space for that.

With ADHD, executive function is delayed—up to 30 percent. That means the eighteen-year-old you’re sending off to college might have the executive function of someone who is twelve. This is why those with ADHD can seem “immature.” It’s also why we can seem as if we’re misbehaving intentionally when we’re not. When we’re not following instructions or meeting expectations, it doesn’t necessarily mean we don’t understand what the expectations are, or that we don’t want to meet them. Often, we don’t have the executive function (yet or right now) to do those things effectively

1. HAVE LESS STUFF TO MANAGE There’s a common saying that regularly makes the rounds in the ADHD community: “If you want to do more, do less.” The more you’re trying to do, the more you have to keep track of—and the harder it is for your executive function system to keep up. That’s true for everyone, but it’s especially true for those of us with impaired executive function. Because we often take on way-the-f*ck more than we can handle, one of the most helpful ways for those with ADHD to better manage their stuff is simply having less of it

Practice minimalism. Minimalism essentially means owning less stuff. It’s a lot easier to manage clutter if you don’t have a lot of stuff to create it. Many ADHDers I’ve met swear by minimalism, because they can function more effectively when they have less to manage, lose, organize, and/or clean. This can work for projects, too; limiting the number of ongoing projects, especially long-term ones, takes pressure off our executive function

Do we have to do less forever? Not necessarily. But because of our neurodevelopmental delay, adults with ADHD are often stretched to their EF limit. If our coping skills don’t increase faster than the demands do, keeping up gets harder and harder, and we sacrifice more and more of ourselves and our well-being

Add scaffolding. Just as you use training wheels to learn how to ride a bike, you can put extra supports in place to help you learn a new system or take on new responsibilities. For example: first, I have someone sit with me and do a thing. Then I’ll sometimes do it on my own. Once I get the hang of it, I’ll do it totally on my own. Scaffolding benefits us because we get the support we need to learn a task—and as we become more confident with it, that support can be pulled away

Look at what’s worked before. We can often reuse and repurpose strategies that have helped us in the past. Even if they’re not a perfect fit, we can often tweak them to make them work better. New systems might be more fun and exciting, but that novelty wears off. The stuff that’s lasted beyond the new and shiny phase is often worth adapting (as needed) and trying again because it’s more likely to stick. Look at what you currently do. If you usually spend an extra half hour after an exciting meeting brainstorming and infodumping at the person in the next meeting, maybe let them know that’s the plan and make sure they’re cool with that? If they’re not, give yourself a buffer between meetings to let your super spinny brain wind down and transition to the next thing. Consider your preferences. Motivation can be a huge challenge for those with ADHD. If you love Doctor Who, getting a Doctor Who key holder might make it more likely you’ll hang your keys there. If you hate spending time in the garage, is that really a good place to put the elliptical, Jessica? [*5] Remember that you have ADHD. Current us isn’t neurotypical.

It was still blurry, but I could feel a sense of purpose growing within me. That’s when I made my decision. It was time to stop shutting myself up in a cage. It was time to get moving, to look around, and learn what I could from it all. Time to go in search of a place where I belonged, a place where I could say with confidence that I felt right. All the trips I went on, all the books I read, were the consequences of that decision. In other words, Takako, meeting you led me to a kind of epiphany.”

I usually understand why I should do (or avoid doing) a thing, but that understanding in and of itself doesn’t translate into usable motivational fuel. It doesn’t matter if the task is critical to something I care deeply about, or entirely irrelevant and a giant waste of my time. What matters is whether or not my brain feels like doing it. Sometimes I really can’t do something unless my brain cooperates. It feels like a hostage negotiation.

When dopamine levels are low, we feel unmotivated, derive less pleasure from everyday tasks, and feel physically tired. Our brains are understimulated. This is why we wait until right before the deadline to get started on a project. It’s why we might make “simple” tasks overly complicated. It’s why we switch up our writing style or the color pens we’re using, or doodle while taking notes. It’s why we do serious things in silly ways. We’re instinctively stimulating and motivating our brains by adding a sense of urgency, challenge, novelty, and interest

Many important life goals, such as getting good grades or getting a raise, are motivating because of the extrinsic reward involved. Of course we’d like to get into a good school and graduate; of course we’d like to make more money. And we’re willing to do what it takes to make that happen—in theory. In practice, those extrinsic consequences—both positive and negative ones—often feel too far away to be motivating, especially when they’re competing with the more immediate rewards of playing video games or partying now.

Of course we’d like to get into a good school and graduate; of course we’d like to make more money. And we’re willing to do what it takes to make that happen—in theory. In practice, those extrinsic consequences—both positive and negative ones—often feel too far away to be motivating, especially when they’re competing with the more immediate rewards of playing video games or partying now. This is due to temporal discounting, where we perceive a desired result in the future as less valuable than one we could have now. Temporal discounting happens for everyone, which is why you might often hear suggestions to reward yourself for a successful week rather than a successful semester. But along with temporal discounting, those with ADHD also have shorter time horizons. A reward that will come next week isn’t going to be motivating in the same way because, to us, next week doesn’t even exist (more on how we experience time in “How to See Time,” this page). ADHD brains are highly sensitive to rewards, but if the rewards aren’t particularly salient (read: alluring), they need to happen more immediately to have any relevance in our decision making. If a task is intrinsically rewarding—enjoyable enough that we don’t need extrinsic rewards to do it—temporal discounting has less impact. It doesn’t matter as much that a reward is far off in the distance. In fact, there’s arguably a benefit to not relying on extrinsic motivation; research has shown that adding extrinsic rewards can actually decrease intrinsic motivation

When we do a “simple” task—say, making a phone call—we’re not just dealing with that task. We’re also dealing with an emotional barrier that has been built from past failures with the task. Brendan Mahan, ADHD coach and founder of ADHD Essentials, calls this barrier a “Wall of Awful.” The more we’ve struggled with a task in the past, the more failure, disappointment, rejection, and worry we’ve experienced as a result. The more of these negative experiences we have endured, the higher that wall.

Everyone has Walls of Awful around tasks they’ve failed at. But according to Brendan, those with ADHD have a lot of them—and they tend to be higher than most. We experience far more failure, criticism, and rejection than our neurotypical peers. Some of the most common emotions that come up for those with ADHD include overwhelm, discouragement, hopelessness, fear, and confusion. To make matters even more complicated, ADHDers typically have relatively weak working memory (see this page to learn more). This means we might not have enough mental bandwidth to remember why we’re doing something, or how it might feel to finish doing it. Instead, all our working memory “slots” may be taken up by trying to figure out (or remember) what we need to do and how we feel about it right now. As a result, all we see is that Wall of Awful. We can’t peer over it. We don’t get any windows to show us what might be on the other side. According to Brendan, there are different ways we deal with this wall. We might get angry enough that we can Hulk-smash through it to get a task done. Unfortunately, that often hurts our relationships, because we’re not always nice about what we say to ourselves (or to others) when we bust through the wall. Sometimes, we can put a door in the wall. We might change our mood with music, turn on a favorite TV show in the background, or work somewhere new to distract ourselves long enough to get the task done. But often, we need to climb the wall. Before we can face the task and effectively engage with it, both now and in the future, we need to do the emotional work of gearing up for it, facing our anxiety, and preparing ourselves to do The Thing. My friend and colleague Dani Donovan, creator of The Anti-Planner, a workbook that includes activities, games, and strategies she designed specifically to address the feelings that get in the way of our tasks, puts it well: “Learning how to identify what’s causing your mental resistance makes it easier to find or create a tailored solution that addresses those specific feelings.”

Motivation is just one part of a bigger “get stuff done” system—and it might not be where the problem is. Consider these possibilities: A skill gap: You don’t entirely know (or remember) how to do The Thing or the steps involved. A lack of resources: You don’t have what you need to get The Thing done. For example, you might not have enough time, supplies, or energy. Perfectionism: Perfectionism, and the anxiety that goes hand in hand with it, can keep you from getting started or keep you stuck in mental loops. Overly optimistic thinking: You might assume that you can get to something tomorrow without checking to see if you’re giving yourself enough time to do it. (This is known as positive illusory bias.) Forgetfulness: Thanks to ADHD-related memory challenges (see “How to Remember Stuff,” this page), you might not remember what your goals even are. An unrealistic goal: The goal you chose isn’t attainable—or sustainable

Turn a marathon project into a series of mini sprints so you can get started before it’s almost due. Adding a sense of urgency to tasks now can keep them from becoming a crisis later. Find the right level of challenging. If something is too easy, it might be too boring; if it’s too difficult, it can be too frustrating and discouraging to keep going.

Remove physical obstacles and other barriers. If something is in the way of the piano, it’s going to make it harder for you to play the piano. If a task is overwhelming for sensory reasons—for example, there’s something about it that is too bright, too noisy, or too icky—find a tool that helps you avoid the unpleasant experience. Use gloves while washing dishes, earplugs for noisy trips, or sunglasses for running errands outside.[*4] Invest in tools you enjoy using. Many of us have negative associations with tasks partly due to the tools we associate with the task. Choosing ones that feel good and look nice is a great way to “grease the wheels” toward doing The Thing. Plus, it can make or save us money in the long run. For example, how much have we spent on takeout because the “nice pans” or tools that might make cooking easier are “too expensive”? Tap into your “why.” There’s a reason you’re doing The Thing. What’s the reason? It might not be about the task itself. There’s a sweet example of this in an episode of The Simpsons. When Homer went back to work after Maggie was born, he papered pictures of her over a foreboding sign from his boss that read “Don’t forget. You’re here forever.” The baby pictures covered enough letters so the sign now read “Do it for her.” Ride the wave.

Decide on what you’re doing—and not doing. Sometimes, all we need in terms of accountability is to get clear on what we’re doing and what can wait. If you need support with figuring this out, coaches, therapists, and even a friend or coworker can help you make (and adjust) a plan to ensure progress on things that are important to you. Find productivity partners. There are a lot of groups designed to help people connect and support each other toward specific goals; you can also ask someone to “body double” with you—sit quietly in a room with you while you work. This can include going to public places where others are working or studying, because there’s low-key social pressure for you to do the same. Shorten the feedback loop. Sometimes we have trouble finishing a project because we get stuck on one part of it; sometimes it’s because the deadline is too far away to kick our brains into gear. Either way, asking for shorter deadlines and/or more frequent check-ins can help. Those check-ins can be with your boss, colleagues, or random friends: “Hey, this Friday

Note on Procrastination Procrastinating is common for those with ADHD—and for good reason. The sense of urgency we feel as a deadline approaches kicks our brain into gear. Starting closer to a deadline instead of well ahead of time, as many of us have learned, can save us a lot of time and mental energy. But how you procrastinate matters. Research suggests that those who engage in what is called active procrastination—the “wait until your brain kicks into gear” or “put off homework until the night before it’s due” form of procrastination—experience similar performance and outcomes as nonprocrastinators. On the other hand, those who engage in passive procrastination—the “head in the sand” form where you avoid even thinking about The Thing—are more likely to experience negative outcomes such as poor grades, missed opportunities, and—I don’t remember what else. Ironically, I keep procrastinating on revisiting the research. Even so, active procrastination has its costs. You might still have to blow off something important as you try to get the more urgent task done. Your efforts might affect how well your brain will function the next day. Sometimes these costs are worth it; sometimes they’re not. The takeaway? It’s unrealistic to expect anyone, especially someone with ADHD, not to procrastinate at all. But if you’re going to procrastinate, procrastinate mindfully

Pick a reward that is meaningful to you. Different people respond differently to different rewards. Maybe the best reward for you is something you don’t often let yourself have or something that’s related to the steps you’re taking to reach a goal. I like to buy myself fitness gear as I keep working out, and soft cozy sweaters to write in as I make progress. If a reward is personally meaningful, it’s more likely to motivate you. Scale a reward strategically. Think economics. If a reward is too big, it floods the reward market and inflation happens. If you reward yourself with sushi for emptying the dishwasher, that is now what emptying the dishwasher costs. Good luck trying to convince your brain to do the same task tomorrow for less. At the same time, if it’s not big enough, it won’t be motivating enough: “Okay, I am not emptying the dishwasher for five minutes of video game time. Emptying the dishwasher takes me longer than that!” Make the reward more immediate. A reward that happens right away is one that is more salient. Immediate positive feedback is a great example. You can also try rewarding yourself as you go, or pairing something rewarding with the activity itself. If a reward is “stuck” in the future—like an upcoming trip you have planned—make your progress more

Give yourself the reward for doing The Thing. Rewards don’t work as motivational fuel if you give them to yourself regardless of your efforts—or don’t give them to yourself at all. Make sure you can enjoy your reward soon after you’ve finished (or made progress on!) a task, but put barriers in place until you reach a certain point.[*6

DON’T EXPECT YOURSELF TO STICK WITH THINGS Hang with me here. A lot of the time, we start a new venture without an end date. We might assume this new habit, job, hobby is the one, and we’re going to do it forever. We understandably get frustrated and disappointed when it doesn’t turn out that way. Instead of expecting we’ll magically be able to stick to things despite all past evidence to the contrary, it’s often more helpful to plan for the variability in interest and motivation inherent to ADHD. Cycle through hobbies, jobs, and interests. When the novelty of one thing wears off, it’s fine to switch to something else. Stepping away from something gives it the opportunity to feel new again. Be a bumblebee. Carry what you learned from one experience and use it to “pollinate” your next venture. Those with ADHD are often referred to as a “jack of all trades, master of none,” but have you heard the expanded version of that quote? It says, “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than master of one.” There’s value in building a diverse skill set. Set a date to reevaluate. Agree to stick to something for a set amount of time, whatever feels reasonable for you to commit to. When you reach your end date, see if it’s worth continuing with what you’re doing. That way, we don’t keep putting time and energy into something that isn’t working for

I also got advice from friends. Dani, who was actually a goalie as a kid, told me, “It can feel like the entire game comes down to you and missing the ball, so it’s easy to take all the blame on yourself. But there are a lot of other people on that team who are involved in whether you win or lose. Sometimes the system that you’re operating in isn’t exactly setting you up for success. Even if it is, it is so unrealistic to expect yourself to save every ball. Come to terms with the fact that you’re going to miss some—and that’s gotta be okay.” When something I tried didn’t work out, I learned from the experience. I reminded myself what I could try differently next time. And the next time I needed to write, I showed up

The traditional civilization of Japan does not look for satisfaction by some change in the condition of others but in that of the self. The main difference between the West and Japan is that the latter civilization has developed on the basic assumption that one’s external environment cannot be significantly changed. If father and son cannot get along together, Westerners seek to establish domestic peace and quiet by changing the parent-child relationship, whereas we in Japan accept that relationship as immutable and strive, within that fixed relationship, to find a workable pattern for the restoration of domestic harmony. We take the same attitude toward any difficulties that may arise in such other fixed relationships as those between husband and wife, between master and servant, between the merchant and the warrior classes. We hold our attitude to be consonant with, indeed a reflection of, nature itself. If some mountain range blocks our free passage to a neighboring country, we do not seek to flatten the mountain, to restructure the natural order. Instead we work out some arrangement under which the need to visit that neighboring country no longer arises.

Under the surface, though, it’s not so cute or quirky. ADHDers forget things all the time—and we work ourselves into the ground compensating for the things that slip our minds. It’s cost me self-esteem. When I’d realize I’d forgotten obvious or important stuff, the negative thoughts were immediate and automatic. Judgments starting with “I’m so” and “I’m such a” played in my head and sometimes spilled out of my mouth.

If the new information is easy for us to understand and related to a familiar subject, the encoding process can be quick and easy. If, on the other hand, we have no clue what someone is talking about—possibly because we missed or didn’t encode the foundational knowledge well enough—we may not have enough time for this process to take place. Before our brains are able to encode it, new information comes in and bumps it out of our working memory.

Give yourself a hook to hang new info on. Those with “great” memory are those who can chunk data together more effectively. Giving yourself a “hook” to hang it on can help. Ask for questions or topics in advance, get an overview of what a meeting will cover, ask what a story is about (so you understand how the details relate), or quickly review new material before trying to intentionally learn it. Use active studying strategies. Our brains are more likely to wander when we use passive study techniques, such as reading. Doing something with the material engages the part of our brain that makes up the task positive network, which shuts the door on the default mode network (see this page—it’s responsible for our chronic mind-wandering). Write down the information, make and use flash cards, take notes from a textbook. Make it sticky. We remember things best when they are meaningful to us or when they stand out as odd. Put what you learn into your own form of expression. Turn something you want to remember into a story, acronym, joke, or drawing. Act it out. Use silly voices!

“I leave objects out if I need to do something with them, which is a huge part of why I come across as a ‘messy’ person. I leave things in places where I can’t ignore them; if I put bills away in a fle or something, for example, I would one hundred percent forget that they exist. I leave the garbage bag out in the middle of the hallway so I won’t forget to take it out for trash day. I leave unfnished tasks out and open so that when my brain starts looking for something new, I might land on an existing project and work on that some more.” THE JOY OF FORGETTING My working memory is the most impaired aspect of my ADHD brain. I suspected this was the case from the moment I learned what working memory was. It was confirmed later when I had it tested. As the report delightfully understates, my working memory is a “relative area of weakness.” The good news is, not everything is something I want to remember.

Forgetting what my limits are lets me jump into a new project with enthusiasm and ambition. It also gives me the opportunity to test what those limits even are. Sometimes they’ve changed! Forgetfulness has given me experiences and an entire career that I wouldn’t otherwise have.

My memory challenges have strengthened my faith, even in things I can’t see or feel or touch, because so much in my life is a dream or a memory, fuzzy at the seams, brought into focus only by my imagination. The picture that comes to mind of the earrings I lost as a kid is no clearer to me than the picture of the future I hope for. But I believe in them both. I trust in their existence

One of my favorite things about my forgetfulness is that when I get excited about a new project, I forget how hard the last one was. I forget about the downsides and potential negative consequences, the long hours and the sitting in my car crying. There’s a cost to this forgetfulness, as I learned and will share at the end of this book. But the reason I dream so big and do big things is because I forget about the constraints of reality, for a bit, and I go after what I want without considering what might get in the way. Many of us do the same. It’s one of our strengths.

As I reached the Saveur, my feet stopped on their own. Seeing the orange light of its sign shining in the lonely street at night, I was like Pavlov’s dog—it triggered a sudden urge to drink coffee.

“If I’d never gone to the shop, I’d still be living my life in a daze. I met so many people there, and I learned so many things, and, of course, there were all of the books I discovered. I feel like I finally learned to see something a tiny bit valuable within myself. That’s why I know that I’ll never forget the days I spent at the bookshop.” Although this was the first time I’d ever really spoken to him, the words came pouring out of my mouth with such force I couldn’t help myself

After that night, I went to the coffee shop a third time, but Wada wasn’t there. I knew there was no reason for me to expect him to be around, but I still somehow felt let down.

Matsugorō’s painful, single-minded obsession hit home for me. After I finished the book, my heart fell silent. Tears ran down my cheeks and dropped onto the book, leaving little stains on the pages. Under the covers of my futon, as I drifted off to sleep, I found myself thinking that Wada had a pretty romantic side. In my dream that night, I was the woman who ran the café in the novel, and I was shaking Ukiyō by the shoulders, doing my best to persuade her to go out with Matsugorō

Or rather, was that why he transferred all those emotions to the novel and kept reading it over and over? Oh, what the hell. I kept repeating the words to myself again and again. It’s not that I was particularly sad. Somehow deep down I’d always had the feeling that he didn’t think of me like that. I just felt like a complete idiot for letting myself get so worked up over everything. What about the weird way we could talk and talk? Or the way we felt like old friends? None of that was real. Wada was kind enough to listen to me, and I took advantage of that and talked about myself. That’s what really made me feel good. I felt so guilty when I finally realized this. “I’m sorry. It’s not a very interesting story,” Wada said apologetically, perhaps because he’d noticed that I’d been looking down all this time. I shook my head.“No, I’m the one who should apologize.” “What? Why should you apologize, Takako?” Wada seemed surprised. “Just because.” “Huh?” I really wanted to apologize more, but I also didn’t want him to think I was weird, so I held back. I’ve got to change the subject, I thought, but I

Finally, she seemed to understand and gave in. Her body relaxed, and she let her head rest on my shoulder. “I give up.

Outside, the sky is clear. A few large clouds drift pleasantly overhead. I stretch my arms up high and shut my eyes for a moment. I can feel the warm sunlight pressing on my eyelids. “Hey, if you don’t hurry up, I’m leaving you behind.” I open my eyes when I hear her voice. Up the street, Momoko turns back to look at me. The sun glints off her new short hair and she smiles. “Come on, come on,” she says, waving to me. And then she dashes ahead. For a moment, I watch her from behind as she walks away. Then I run down the street after her.

“I’m doing my best to make a mirror.” In some surprise the scholar pointed out that, though the priest was a man of marvelous parts, no man in the world could ever polish a tile to be a mirror. “In that case,” said the priest, “I’ll stop the polishing. But,” and he burst out laughing, “the parallel would seem to be that no man learns enlightenment by scholarly perusal of whole libraries of books.” It may be that my master has heard some version of this tale about the uselessness of scholarship and, armed with the bathroom mirror, now seeks triumphantly to demonstrate that nothingness is all. I watch him cautiously, suddenly conscious that his mental instability may well be taking a dangerous turn.

Actually, a mirror is a sinister thing. I’m told it takes real courage, alone at night, in a large room lit by a single candle, to stare into a mirror.

Nor is that all.

Which explains why all great men invariably achieve greatness solely by their own efforts. If it were true that you could learn to understand yourself by virtue of someone else’s helping effort, then you could, for instance, declare whether some hunk of meat were tough or tender by getting someone else to eat it for you. But hearing truths preached in the morning, listening all evening to learned expositions of the Way, reading scholarly tomes the night long in your study—all these worthy activities are nothing but disciplines designed to facilitate your perception of your own true self. Yet that true self of yours cannot conceivably exist in the truth preached at you by some other person, or in the Way some other man expounds, or in ancient books however heaped upon you.

A mirror is a vat for brewing self-conceit, yet, at the same time, a means to neutralize all vanity. Nothing shows up the absurd pretensions of a show-off more incitingly than a mirror. Since time began, the pretentious and the vainglorious have gone about the world inflicting damage both upon themselves and upon others, and the first cause of at least two-thirds of that injury undoubtedly lay in mirrors.

On the other hand, for persons beginning to sicken into self-disgust and for persons already feeling spiritually shriveled, there’s nothing quite so tonic as a good long look in a mirror. For any such observer cannot fail to realize as a staggering fact the effrontery of his having dared to go about for years with such an appalling face. The moment of that realization is the most precious moment in any man’s life, and none looks more exaltedly transfigured than a fool grown self-enlightened to his own intrinsic folly.

When due regard is given to other people but those other people do not reciprocate, then, instead of just complaining, the discontented are liable, every now and again, to seek redress of their grievance by some positive action. Such spasmodic action is called revolution. Revolutions are not the work of mere grumblers, but are the happy handiwork of high-ranking and distinguished persons who enjoy promoting them.

No matter how incomprehensible a phrase may be, a willing listener can always wring some kind of message out of it. You can say mankind is stupid or that mankind is astute: either way, the statement makes some sense. Indeed, one can go much further. It is not incomprehensible if one says that human beings are dogs or pigs. Nor would it occasion any surprise if one stated that a mountain was low; or that the universe is small. One could well get away with claiming that crows are white, that living dolls are dead ugly, even that my master is a man of worth. It follows that even a letter as weird as Mr. Fair’s could, if one really bent one’s mind to the effort, be twisted to make sense.

Habitually he values whatever he does not understand, but he is by no means alone in that behavior. Something unignorable lurks in whatever passes our understanding, and there is something inherently noble in that which we cannot measure. For which reason laymen are loud in their praises of matters they do not understand and scholars lecture unintelligibly on points as clear as day. This lesson is daily demonstrated in our universities, where incomprehensible lectures are both deeply respected and popular, while those whose words are easily understood are shunned as shallow thinkers.

If, he says, one focuses one’s mind upon the movements of an enemy, then the mind will be entrammeled by and subject to such movements. If upon a foeman’s sword, then mind will be subjected to that sword. Correspondingly, if one’s mind is concentrated upon the thought of wishing to kill an enemy, that thought will dominate all else. If concentrated upon one’s own sword, then it will become effectively possessed by one’s own sword. If one’s mind centers upon the idea that one does not wish to be killed, then it becomes possessed by that idea. If one’s mind is bent solely upon someone’s posture, then one’s mind will be absorbed to be that posture. In brief there is nowhere that a mind can be directed without ceasing to be itself. Thus, wherever the mind is, it becomes, by definition, non-existent.”

“Similarly, the magpie was originally a maggot pie, not because it had anything to do with either maggots or meat pies, but because this pied, this black-and-white crow, was still earlier named a Margaret pie; just as the sparrow was dubbed Phillip, the redbreast Robin, and some tits Tom. Margaret and its associated nicknames seem to have been particularly fruitful in this field of linguistics, for it was also from that name that the owl came to be called a madge.

Perhaps our vaunted social organization is merely a kind of bear-garden, where lunatics gather together, grapple desperately, bicker and tussle with each other, call each other filthy names, tumble and sprawl all over each other in mindless muckiness. This agglomeration of lunatics thus becomes a living organism which, like cells, disintegrates and coalesces, crumbles again to nothing and again reintegrates. Is that not the actual nature of our marvelous human society? And within that organism, such few cells as are slightly sensible and exhibit symptoms of discretion inevitably prove a nuisance to the rest. So they find themselves confined in specially constructed lunatic asylums. It would follow that, objectively speaking, those locked up in mental homes are sane, while those careering around outside the walls are all as mad as hatters. An individual lunatic, so long as he’s kept isolated, can be treated as a lunatic, but when lunatics get together and, so massed, acquire the strength of numbers, they also automatically acquire the sanity of numbers. Many lunatics are, by their maniness, healthy persons. It is not uncommon that a powerful lunatic, abusing the authority of his wealth and with myriad minor madmen in his pay, behaves outrageously, but is nevertheless honored and praised by all and sundry as a paragon of human virtue.

According to Dr. James Gross’s process model for emotion regulation, there are fve strategies for managing our emotions: 1. Situation selection: the ability to choose situations that are less likely to lead to emotion regulation challenges. (“I could have my birthday party at da club, but I think I’d feel less overwhelmed if we go to a restaurant instead.”) 2. Situation modifcation: the ability to change or modify a situation known to trigger emotion dysregulation. (“I’ll change seats so I don’t sit next to my friend during bio lecture. I always end up giggling when I do.”) 3. Cognitive change or reappraisal: the ability to change the way we view a situation or our emotional

I didn’t like it anyway! ThIs iS FiNe.”) 4. Attention deployment: the ability to turn our attention away from the source of hard-to-regulate emotions. (“Ugh, my house is such a mess. Crap, feelings! Where’s the remote?”) 5. Response modulation: the attempt to alter our emotional response. (“AUGHH performance anxiety DEEP BREATHS wait, HOW DOES BREATHING WORK? Oh right, in for four…”)

Dan Siegel puts it, you’ve got to “name it to tame it.” Labeling the emotion can diminish the response of the amygdala and limbic system, decreasing our emotional reactivity to negative emotional experiences.

It also increases the likelihood that we’ll take a less helpful action because we haven’t gotten time to process and understand anything yet.

We can also ask others to give us time to think or take away our means of communicating (for example, our phones) when we’re running hot. Sit with your feelings. As my therapist taught me, even our biggest feelings can’t last forever; in most cases, the body can only sustain an intense emotion for about twenty minutes. It can often be less emotionally distressing to sit with your feelings and watch them fade than to dodge them and have them hang around waiting for you to notice them. Take time to explore your emotions. This can mean drawing, painting, or talking them out—with a journal or a third party who may be able to help us process and figure out what, if anything, we want to do next. Feelings are in their rawest form when they first come up. While this is not the best time to communicate them, it can be a great time to write them down. Exploring your feelings on your own while you’re feeling them can make it easier to communicate them when you’re in a better place to effectively do so.

You might not be in actual danger, but your brain might be picking up on something that reminds it of something unsafe. Our emotions can also let us know if our actions are (or aren’t) in line with our values. They can hint at whether something is being received well by another person. They can indicate whether our needs are being met. They point to where our boundaries are (more on boundaries in “How to People,” this page). Paying attention to your emotions can help you navigate a situation more effectively and figure out if you’re on the right track

Foster connection. Expressing what you think can be divisive, but expressing what you feel is typically connecting. Pixar had it right. Expressing sadness brings people together. Communicating how you feel can help you bond with the people you love, mend rifts, and find common ground. Feelings can also help us connect with the world. Communication— whether it’s personal, artistic, or even scientific—moves people more when there’s genuine emotion behind it. People connect better with what you say if you make them laugh or if you make them feel.[

Like, if frustrated is a four, and irritated is a —” “Frustration,” I said. I was allowed to be frustrated. Later, I recognized that was a bit of a cop-out. Because of course I was allowed to be frustrated; I was typically frustrated at myself. So I chose a form of anger that I was allowed to feel about other people’s actions: “irritated.” I decided I was allowed to feel irritated, but even this was scary.

Like many people with ADHD, I didn’t have many close friends growing up. I generally understood the social rules, but I had trouble applying them. I could pretend to belong for a little while, but soon I’d be too loud, too weird, too me, and the others would edge away. Eventually, I learned to edge away, to escape to a place where I did belong.

However, there’s a difference between sensitivity and empathy. While those with ADHD tend to be sensitive and may even pick up on others’ emotions thanks to our higher likelihood to be hypervigilant, we might misunderstand other people’s perspectives and emotions. These misunderstandings can happen either because we miss crucial details about a situation, or because we’re so caught up in our own stories and emotions that we can’t see past them.[*3] Even those who are highly empathic can have a difficult time applying their empathy effectively. Feeling overly sad or distressed when someone else is suffering can make it hard to give them effective support. We might have a hard time regulating our empathy, just like we have a hard time regulating our emotions and our attention.

It’s the fifteen anxious text messages we send when we get home apologizing, explaining, and seeking reassurance. And what drives us to send those texts is the mindset with which we view and approach social situations. Our mindsets are part of what leads to the anxious overcorrection, rumination, and thought spirals that many in our community experience when we navigate social settings. We get stuck trying to understand what went wrong, or why something happened, or how we can fix it. We slip into emotional reasoning: I feel this way, so therefore it must be true.

When it comes to rejection sensitivity, we quite naturally adjust our behavior to avoid it: we peopleplease; we suppress our ADHD and cut off pieces of ourselves trying to ft in; we avoid risky social situations entirely. We’ve been experiencing rejection since before we had metacognition—the ability to think about our thoughts. By the time we’re adults, we’ve learned that we’re often rejected for our behavior, so it makes sense that our go-to strategy for avoiding the pain of rejection is adjusting our behavior. But as I mentioned in the motivation chapter, the lever we instinctively pull is not always the right lever to pull. Those with ADHD often have signifcantly skewed mindsets when it comes to social situations, including the mindset that we need to be someone else entirely to belong (or its other extreme—this is who I am and people just need to deal), and adjusting those mindsets—not our individual behaviors (which often stem from them)—is often what is needed most.

When these friendships do work out, it’s not because of how intensely they started, but because of how they continued. Friendship generally isn’t made (or lost) in a moment. It requires a level of intimacy and mutual trust that is earned with time and experience. The more moments of connection you have with someone, the harder it is to break your bond with them. If you think back to the circles of support diagram on this page, the way you reach the circle of friendship is by going through the circle of participation and working your way in over time

Some people become friends because you spend a lot of time with them. Other people become friends because the time you spend together is always amazing. What matters isn’t strictly how much time you spend with them or whether every minute you spend is incredible, but rather, is the time you spend together enough to stitch you together?

Disappointingly (particularly for those of us who are averse to uncertainty), that’s not always something we can control, rush, or even predict. Lots of hurdles can get in the way of a budding friendship: time constraints, stress from life events, scheduling logistics. Life is complicated. All we can really control is whether we engage in that circle of participation often enough to give a potential friend a chance to become an actual friend

There will always be someone who does not see the unique gifts of my mind; that person will not be me.” 2. MEET NEW PEOPLE We’re not going to click with everyone, but meeting new people is the best way to find the ones with whom we will. This can keep us from getting stuck trying to be friends with people who aren’t a great fit or who treat us badly. It can also help us avoid overrelying on any one person for support, making our relationships more sustainable. Go where people meet people. There are online dating apps that have a “friend” mode and websites for people with common interests to meet (like Bumble BFF or Meetup.org). There’s an immediate advantage to meeting people through channels like these. They’re probably there for the same reason: to find potential friends. Go where your strengths will shine. If your conversation is better than your dance moves, hang out where people can hear you talk. If your dance moves are killer but

ways to connect socially—when you can, choose ones that are in line with your strengths. Prep some conversation topics in advance. Remember cool executive function (this page)? Planning what to talk about is much easier before you’re on the spot (or when your foot is already firmly in your mouth). Caroline suggests having three topics ready to go. (The topics are ideally noncontroversial… and ones that people actually talk about.) Come up with some “get to know you” questions, too! People love talking about themselves. Look for shared values. While shared interests are great for short-term connection, shared values help relationships stand the test of time. Examples of shared values include kindness, honesty, humor, and playfulness.

LEVEL UP YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS When I was learning about social skills for the channel, I realized the reason I thought I was bad at making friends was because, in video game terms, I was playing levels I wasn’t ready for. Thanks to my neurodevelopmental delay, I’ve spent much of my life playing on levels that required skills I hadn’t yet developed. This left me frustrated and not wanting to play. And not playing left me further behind. The truth is, no one is born with social skills. We learn and acquire them, even as adults. Observe others. Caroline calls this being a social spy. Watching what others typically do (and don’t do) in social situations can help us calibrate our understanding and expectations. You can also study how those with your brain type interact with one another. Social norms are often different in neurodivergent communities, and it’s good to be fluent in your own language, too. Otherwise, how will you connect with others who speak it? Ask for stronger social cues. Social feedback loops help people get good at socializing. Unfortunately for us, these

feedback loops typically depend on subtle social cues. If you know you tend to miss or misread those cues, it’s totally fine to ask for them to be more overt. When my friend Alex realized I wasn’t getting a chance to jump into the conversation, she said, “Hey, I know I can talk over people when I get excited. If I do that, say ‘Pongo!’And I’ll know to let you talk.” Try a tutorial. If you’re anxious about not knowing how to navigate a social situation, it can help to know what to expect. Ask someone you trust if there are any pitfalls to look out for. Call the place you’re going and ask what the vibe is like. You can also look up tutorials about how to navigate specific social situations online. (WikiHow is amazing.) “Play” on levels you enjoy. If you get frustrated or incredibly anxious while socializing, it might mean that you’re playing a level you’re not ready for. If Level Three: Going to Yoga Together is enough of a challenge, it may not make sense to struggle through Level Ten: Going on a Yoga Trip Together. Spend most of your time on levels you’re comfortable with, and you’ll probably have a lot more fun. You’ll also play more, which helps with leveling up

Be proactive. Be the one who organizes meetings and don’t only wait for invitations. Today is the best day to plan.” Gwenyth T., 30, Michigan “I have weird little things I do to make sure I’m keeping in touch with my friends. I use the Sweepy app for housework, but I’ve added a ‘social’ section. It helps me see how long it’s been since I’ve texted someone and makes it a part of my to-do list. It helps me remember that the social part of my life is just as vital to my life as cleaning a toilet, and it gives me a little boost from checking something important off my list.”

I wasn’t getting much out of a hangout, especially compared to how much it was costing me.

For instance, I understand that bankers grow so accustomed to handling other people’s money that they come to regard it as their own. Similarly, public officials are the servants of the people and can reasonably be regarded as agents to whom the people have entrusted certain powers to be exercised on the people’s behalf in the running of public affairs. But as these officials grow accustomed to their daily control of affairs, they begin to acquire delusions of grandeur, act as though the authority they exercise was in fact their own and treat the people as though the people had no say in the matter. Since the world is thus demonstrably full of such usurpers, one cannot brand my master as a thief just because of this business with the oblong brazier.

Would common logic or even common sense lead any such patently loony human being to resign his claim to universal lordship? Not on your life! Every idiot specimen would sooner die than surrender his share in the fantasy of human importance. Any creature that behaves with such blatant inconsistency and yet contrives never to recognize the least minim of self-contradiction in its behavior is, of course, funny. But since the human animal is indeed funny, it follows that the creature is a fool. The foregoing events occurred precisely as I have recorded them and, as external realities, they left their quaint, little ripples on the stream of time. But in this particular case it was not their manifested conduct which made my master,Yukie, and Yore strike me as amusing.

Would common logic or even common sense lead any such patently loony human being to resign his claim to universal lordship? Not on your life! Every idiot specimen would sooner die than surrender his share in the fantasy of human importance. Any creature that behaves with such blatant inconsistency and yet contrives never to recognize the least minim of self-contradiction in its behavior is, of course, funny. But since the human animal is indeed funny, it follows that the creature is a fool.

Go is a product of the mind of man and, just as human taste is accurately mirrored in this ever-more-restrictive game, so one may see in the cramping of the pieces an image of the human urge to be jammed up tight together. In that ugly crowding one may fairly read man’s mean antipathy to openness, his deliberate squeezing and diminishment of the very universe, his passion for territorial limitation within such dwarfish boundaries that he rarely steps beyond his own immediate shadow. He wallows in the rigors of constriction, in the painful inhibitions of his choice. He is, in short, a masochist.

One of the most common symptoms of depression is anhedonia, which is defined as “markedly diminished interest or pleasure.” When ADHD motivation relies on interest, and on us being able to reward ourselves for doing things that aren’t interesting, anhedonia can be significantly disabling. Depression can worsen the self-esteem issues that many ADHDers have. Depression tells us we are useless, a failure, a burden. Intrusive, judgmental thoughts like these make it easier to believe the negative labels and assessments we too often receive from the outside world

Anxious rumination—basically, thoughts cycling like a broken record of badness—is a common result of anxiety and ADHD. Anxious thoughts keep us stuck in our heads, making it paradoxically more likely that we’ll miss important information, which can lead to more errors, which leads to more anxiety. Sometimes anxiety can lead to hypervigilance. Because anxiety is convinced that it’s helping us survive, anxious watchfulness is reinforced when it catches something we might otherwise have missed due to our ADHD. Also, ADHD brains are motivated by urgency, and anxiety is great at creating a sense of urgency. This can cause issues in ADHD brains who are treated for anxiety but not ADHD: they often find themselves struggling to be productive without the anxiety to propel them.

Hormones: ADHD is often detected during or right after puberty due to the rapid hormonal changes involved. Higher levels of testosterone, which increases sevenfold during male puberty, have been linked to more impulsive decisions and greater hyperactivity. Estrogen, on the other hand, is associated with dopamine production. When estrogen levels rise, dopamine levels rise, too. Estrogen levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, which can worsen ADHD symptoms during the premenstrual phase (the days or week leading up to our

Socialization / societal expectations: Those with ADHD often find themselves out of step with societal expectations. ADHDers are more often gender-nonconforming. There are many reasons for this, one of them being that we commonly have difficulties meeting (often gender-based) societal expectations. Societal expectations vary depending on the culture you come from and exist within, and we often contend with multiple subcultures that each demand different things from us. However, meeting any expectations—from work, friends, family, society, and our political or ideological communities—requires executive function, and trying to meet all of these expectations often overloads our capacity to cope with competing demands

Changing demands: Certain life events—moving, marriage, starting a family, changing careers, taking care of aging parents —come with significantly increased demands on executive function. Someone who starts college, for example, may experience what researchers call a “double deficit.” They may struggle simultaneously with increased demands on their executive function from tasks (such as registering for classes, navigating a new campus, accessing accommodations, feeding themselves), as well as the new social context and additional social pressures that come with making new friends, living with roommates, dating, and attending parties.

factors combine with the effects of living with ADHD.[*9] Cultural differences, medical discrimination, and lack of access to care may lead to that anxiety being untreated, and untreated anxiety can lead to depression, all of which can make the ADHD more diffcult to manage. The pressure on students to excel academically and the pressure on parents to support their children’s performance in certain cultures can be benefcial for students with ADHD. For example, the parents of a student struggling in school may engage a tutor that works with their learning style, which can lead to a positive outcome. However, that same cultural emphasis on academic achievement can cause parents to feel stress and shame about their child’s diffculties. It may incentivize the parents to stay up until two a.m. every night to help their children with homework. It may also discourage them from seeking mental health or learning support for their child because they think they just aren’t “doing enough

SEEK COMMUNITY WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARE YOUR COEXISTING CONDITIONS, IDENTITIES, AND BACKGROUND There is robust literature showing that for ADHD brains, interacting with others who share your diagnosis can increase support and reduce stigma. I’ve seen this again and again in the How to ADHD community. Our community is intentionally built to be as inclusive to those who are neurodivergent as possible. It includes Brains and Hearts from all around the world who have enthusiastic conversations about shared experiences, individual factors, and their individual intersectionalities, which serve to normalize those experiences, help us practice self-advocating, and increase compassion and understanding of other stigmatized differences. Of course, there are going to be limitations to any community in terms of finding the understanding and social support you need. For example, the main purpose of the How to ADHD community is to facilitate discussions about—well, ADHD, and to be accessible for ADHD Brains and the Hearts who love them not just in the US but internationally. Our community guidelines are built with those goals in mind. Each community serves a purpose, and even the most experienced community managers and moderators have their hands full trying to meet the needs of the group as a whole in service of that purpose. Because of that, no one community is likely to meet all of our individual needs for understanding and belonging. As social creatures, we all need and deserve understanding and belonging, not for one aspect of our identity but for all of

Not only are there executive function challenges that make it difficult for us to “do our part” consistently, there are also aspects about neurodivergence that look very different from the inside than they do from the outside. This can make it look as though we don’t even care, especially when we’re pushing back against expectations we’re struggling to meet

We are taught that accomplishment comes from effort. If someone is not accomplishing something, they must not be putting in enough effort. This isn’t true for those of us with ADHD. We often must put in significantly more effort than our neurotypical peers to achieve the same results—and frequently our effort doesn’t look very effortful. Sometimes our effort isn’t obvious. We may have forgotten the instructions, misunderstood what was being asked, or put our effort toward the wrong task. Much of our effort might not be visible at all because it is happening internally.

(Check out Chapter 7, “How to Motivate Your Brain,” this page, to learn more.) Improvement takes time, and progress is rarely linear. It’s not unreasonable to want the person you love to improve in the areas where they struggle. They probably want that, too! What is often unreasonable, whether we’re trying to change ourselves or support someone we love, is our expectations of the rate and magnitude of the change

THERE ARE REASONS WHY WE CAN’T “JUST” Many of the expectations we place on those we love rely on the idea that they should be able to do The Thing. As a society, we tend to assume people’s intelligence and capabilities based on characteristics such as their verbal ability, long-term recall, or even the work they do for a living. If my partner is a well-spoken psychologist who can name the exact title of season four, episode eleven of Star Trek: The Next Generation (it’s “Data’s Day,” he just informed me), he should be able to figure out how to buy me flowers, right?

We’ve gone over many of these in previous chapters already, so I’ll just drop in a quick list: processing speed, working memory, pattern recognition, set-shifting, response inhibition, verbal comprehension, visual spatial ability, perceptual reasoning. Several of these cognitive abilities are significantly impaired in ADHD brains—at least relative to our areas of cognitive strength. In addition, some combinations of abilities are more challenging for some brains than others. For example, I might have no trouble understanding a recipe I’m reading—my verbal comprehension is extremely high—but my poor response inhibition makes it hard for me to stay focused (and in the kitchen) long enough to prep and cook dinner. Even if I stay focused, my relatively weak working memory means I will one hundred percent forget the instructions two steps in

Inconsistency Is Part of the Deal One of the most common frustrations for those with ADHD and those who love them is knowing we’re capable of doing the thing—and still for some reason aren’t doing it when we’re expected to. Yes, just because we could take care of something yesterday doesn’t mean that we can today. Maybe we were hyperfocusing for twelve hours yesterday and now our brains are too exhausted to focus. Maybe we didn’t sleep well and our emotional self-regulation went completely out the window. Maybe there were more distractions today

“When I was bored, I would turn to my husband for stimulation, which he ultimately could not keep up with. He wouldn’t respond with the adoration and interest I craved, so I felt lonely and unloved. He felt overwhelmed and like a bad person for hurting me.” Chad M., 36, Texas “ADHD almost ended my marriage. My wife didn’t know what she was getting into. It became a perpetual cycle of me trying my best while she felt like I couldn’t care less. I fnally got on meds, and it changed everything. My wife could see the sudden and signifcant change, which helped her see that it wasn’t that I didn’t care; I just couldn’t show it. There was still a lot of pain to work through, and my ADHD is still a challenge for us. But we learned to differentiate actions from motives.

Ask about their experience. While those with ADHD often have very similar stories, strengths, and struggles, there are also profound differences in its presentation, how they feel about their diagnosis and challenges, what they’ve tried, and what works for them. Getting curious about someone’s individual experience—and accepting their answers, even if they’re surprising—is key to understanding them and helping them feel understood. Ask about their inner world and thought processes. You might think you know what your loved one with ADHD is thinking or why they did (or didn’t) do a thing, but if their brain works very differently from yours, there’s a decent chance you’ll be wrong. Remember the double empathy problem (this page)? Instead of assuming, ask

Prioritize. Those with ADHD often have trouble prioritizing. If there are ten things to work on, we might choose one that’s not as important—or the least taxing on our executive function. We might get overwhelmed and not work on any of them at all. Choosing one thing to focus on at a time (maybe two) improves the likelihood that we’ll make progress on it. What task, if left undone, is affecting the relationship the most? What would create the most positive impact if it were to change? Let us fail. This one is especially important for parents. Many parents are afraid to let us do things our way because they’re worried we’ll fail if they do. We might! But having the space to try—and fail—while we have a safety net in place is important. It gives us the opportunity to figure out what does work for us before we’re off on our own and taking on even more. It also builds our resilience. Let us practice doing things on our own now that we’ll need to do on our own when you’re not around. Let some stuff go. Maybe we never get around to removing the bathroom wallpaper—whatever, it’s kitsch. My boyfriend’s

learned to accept that if I’m making dinner, I’ll need to use a recipe, which means we’re probably going to have leftover fennel taking up space in the fridge. As Dr. Ari Tuckman put it in an interview on my channel: “Yeah, I don’t love this thing about my partner, but whatever—there’s a lot of things in my life I don’t love.” Find other solutions with the “milk carton rule.” The milk carton rule is inspired by a story of a real-life couple. The wife leaves the milk out after pouring some for her morning coffee, and when the husband comes downstairs for breakfast, he has to use warm milk for his cereal. The husband asks the wife to put the milk back in the fridge, but she keeps forgetting—and leaving it out. One way to resolve the issue is to keep reminding the wife to put the milk back, but the husband has another option: buying his own carton of milk. Many times, a problem can be solved in a way that does not depend on us being able to change our (often ADHD-related) behavior

The way in which you collaborate and the degree to which you do it will depend on the type of relationship you have with the person—but the most effective solutions usually involve some level of collaboration. Be clear on the goal. Make sure everyone agrees on what the goal is—and understands why you’re working toward it. This way, you’re on the same team. Defining together what success looks like ahead of time for a goal, week, or outing can also make it easier for everyone to recognize when it’s been achieved.

Allow us to achieve the goal in a way that works for us. ADHD Brains are capable of accomplishing a lot; we just might go about it a bit differently. Allowing for equifinality— achieving the same result through different means—can be the difference between us being able to accomplish tasks and leaving them undone. (Or you having to do them all yourself.) Look for the “and.” I love this concept from the book Crucial Conversations. Don’t compromise if you can help it. That can lead to resentment on both sides, because both people are having to sacrifice something that matters to them. Instead, look for a solution that fully meets your needs—and theirs.[*5] While we might struggle at executing, we often excel at ideating. We can come up with lots of potential solutions, especially if we’re given time to let them percolate. You just might wanna help us narrow them down. Stay in your lane. At the end of the day, you are your Brain’s partner/friend/parent/roommate, not their coach or therapist. It’s incredibly easy to get caught up with someone’s mental health struggles, but being someone’s main source of support inevitably comes at the expense of the role you already have. Parenting a partner kills desire. Playing therapist to a friend requires removing yourself from the equation so you can be objective, which comes at the expense of connection. Rather than being someone’s support system, support them in building one. If they don’t want to, or can’t, make it clear that their need for support can’t fall entirely on you

Change often happens over time. It starts by planting seeds that take time to grow. Or casting a stone and seeing where the ripples go. We need to stock up on fuel for what can sometimes be a long and frustrating ride. Keep an “inspiration for a rainy day” fle. When I started posting videos, I read every comment, and saved the ones that made me feel appreciated or showed me I was making a difference.

Change often happens over time. It starts by planting seeds that take time to grow. Or casting a stone and seeing where the ripples go. We need to stock up on fuel for what can sometimes be a long and frustrating ride. Keep an “inspiration for a rainy day” fle. When I started posting videos, I read every comment, and saved the ones that made me feel appreciated or showed me I was making a difference. Rereading them on days when I was exhausted or discouraged kept me going. Making an inspiration or feel-good file can help you stay positive as well as tap into your emotional “why” when you (inevitably) forget why you thought this was a good idea. Be the person you needed. Many advocates doing incredible work are able to sustain it because we’re creating what we needed and didn’t have. If you create the kind of support you needed, chances are it will benefit others, too—and you’ll be able to tap into the memory of how important it was for you. Spend some time ideating. Our brains excel at being creative, generating new ideas, and thinking outside the box. Dream up the future you’d like to help build. What does it look like? Who does it serve? How so? What is happening in other pockets of the world, and what might make sense to implement in ours?

Looking where you want to go, and encouraging people to go there, is much more effective than trying to correct people on what you don’t want. Set constructive goals. Without a positive goal to work toward, both small and big picture, it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to avoid negative outcomes, which can lead us to avoid taking the action that would lead to a positive one. You can’t make a basket if you’re so afraid of missing the hoop you never shoot the ball. (If you keep forgetting your goals, that’s ADHD normal. Flip back to “How to Remember Stuff,” this page.)

There have been lots of warning signs that indicate a path isn’t working out for me or going to get me where I’m trying to go. But no matter how many warning signs I pass, I still sometimes get stuck on following it, especially now that I have so many options for navigating the obstacles along the way. In a way, I’m still trying harder—just with more ADHDfriendly options in my toolbox. If I want true empowerment, it’s not enough to have choice in how I navigate the obstacles on my path. I need choice as to what paths I follow, too. I need choice in whether to continue down them. With the support of a grief and loss counselor, I’m learning to give myself that choice.[*

The combination of loss aversion with mindless choosing implies that if an option is designated as the “default,” it will attract a large market share. Default options thus act as powerful nudges. In many contexts defaults have some extra nudging power because consumers may feel, rightly or wrongly, that default options come with an implicit endorsement from the default setter, be it the employer, government, or TV scheduler. For this and other reasons, setting the best possible defaults will be a theme we explore often in the course of this book. Framing Suppose that you are suffering from serious heart disease and that your doctor proposes a grueling operation. You’re understandably curious about the odds. The doctor says, “Of one hundred patients who have this operation, ninety are alive after five years.” What will you do? If we fill in the facts in a certain way, the doctor’s statement will be pretty comforting, and you’ll probably have the operation. But suppose the doctor frames his answer in a somewhat different way. Suppose that he says, “Of one hundred patients who have this operation, ten are dead after five years.” If you’re

For most of us, however, self-control issues arise because we underestimate the effect of arousal. This is something the behavioral economist George Loewenstein (1996) calls the “hot-cold empathy gap.” When in a cold state, we do not appreciate how much our desires and our behavior will be altered when we are “under the influence” of arousal. As a result, our behavior reflects a certain naïveté about the effects that context can have on choice.

If the confederate spoke confidently and firmly, his judgment had a strong influence on the group’s assessment. If the confederate’s estimate was much higher than those initially made by others, the group’s judgment would be inflated; if the confederate’s estimate was very low, the group’s estimate would fall. A little nudge, if it was expressed confidently, could have major consequences for the group’s conclusion.

Some key studies were undertaken in the 1930s by the psychologist Muzafer Sherif (1937).

In a series of experiments, people using Sherif’s basic method have shown that an arbitrary “tradition,” in the form of some judgment about the distance, can become entrenched over time, so that many people follow it notwithstanding its original arbitrariness.5 We can see here why many groups fall prey to what is known as “collective conservatism”: the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise. Once a practice (like wearing ties) has become established, it is likely to be perpetuated, even if there is no particular basis for it. Sometimes a tradition can last for a long time, and receive support or at least acquiescence from large numbers of people, even though it was originally the product of a small nudge from a few people or perhaps even one. Of course, a group will shift if it can be shown that the practice is causing serious problems. But if there is uncertainty on that question, people might well continue doing what they have always done.

“pluralistic ignorance”—that is, ignorance, on the part of all or most, about what other people think. We may follow a practice or a tradition not because we like it, or even think it defensible, but merely because we think that most other people like it. Many social practices persist for this reason, and a small shock, or nudge, can dislodge them.6 A dramatic example is communism in the former Soviet bloc, which lasted in part because people were unaware how many people despised the regime.

Cultural Change, Political Change, and Unpredictability Might culture and politics be affected by conformity? Might companies be able to make money by enlisting conformity? Consider some evidence involving music downloads. Matthew Salganik and his coauthors (2006) created an artificial music market, with 14,341 participants who were visitors to a Web site popular with young people. The participants were given a list of previously unknown songs from unknown bands. They were asked to listen to a brief selection of any songs that interested them, to decide which songs (if any) to download, and to assign a rating to the songs they chose.

The nudge provided by asking people what they intend to do can be accentuated by asking them when and how they plan to do it. This insight falls into the category of what the great psychologist Kurt Lewin called “channel factors,” a term he used for small influences that could either facilitate or inhibit certain behaviors.

It turns out that if certain objects are made visible and salient, people’s behavior can be affected. Objects characteristic of business environments, such as briefcases and boardroom tables, make people more competitive, less cooperative, and less generous.25 Smells matter too: mere exposure to the scent of an all-purpose cleaner makes people keep their environment cleaner while they eat.

Norman’s basic lesson is that designers need to keep in mind that the users of their objects are Humans who are confronted every day with myriad choices and cues. The goal of this chapter is to develop the same idea for choice architects. If you indirectly influence the choices other people make, you are a choice architect. And since the choices you are influencing are going to be made by Humans, you will want your architecture to reflect a good understanding of how humans behave. In particular, you will want to ensure that the Automatic System doesn’t get all confused. In this chapter, we offer some basic principles of good (and bad) choice architecture.

Leaving the gas cap behind is a special kind of predictable error psychologists call a “postcompletion” error.2 The idea is that when you have finished your main task, you tend to forget things relating to previous steps. Other examples include leaving your ATM card in the machine after getting your cash, or leaving the original in the copying machine after getting your copies. Most ATMs (but not all) no longer allow this error because you get your card back immediately. Another strategy, suggested by Norman, is to use what he calls a “forcing function,” meaning that in order to get what you want, you have to do something else first. So if in order to get your cash, you have to remove the card, you will not forget to do so.

But for kids who start out on kids’ TV, it’s a career death sentence. There’s something about the one-dimensional, overly glossy image combined with the extent of the public recognition of that image that makes it nearly impossible to overcome. The second the child star tries to outgrow and break free from their image, they become bait for the media, highly publicized as rebellious, troubled, and tortured, when all they’re trying to do is grow. Growing is wobbly and full of mistakes, especially as a teenager—mistakes that you certainly don’t want to make in the public eye, let alone be known for for the rest of your life.

The transition from child stardom to a legitimate career as an adult in the entertainment industry is a notoriously tough one—even for young actors blessed with roles in credible films with credible directors. But for kids who start out on kids’ TV, it’s a career death sentence. There’s something about the one-dimensional, overly glossy image combined with the extent of the public recognition of that image that makes it nearly impossible to overcome. The second the child star tries to outgrow and break free from their image, they become bait for the media, highly publicized as rebellious, troubled, and tortured, when all they’re trying to do is grow. Growing is wobbly and full of mistakes, especially as a teenager—mistakes that you certainly don’t want to make in the public eye, let alone be known for for the rest of your life. But that’s what happens when you’re a child star. Child stardom is a trap. A dead end. And I can see that even if Mommy can’t.

Maybe people go to church because they want things from God. And they keep going while they’re wishing and yearning and longing for those things. But then maybe once they get those things, they realize they don’t need church anymore. Who needs God when you’ve got clear mammograms and a series regular role on Nickelodeon?

These simplified enrollment procedures are very much in the spirit of the “channel factors” we mentioned in Chapter 3. People really do want to join the plan, and if you dig a channel for them to slide down that removes the seemingly tiny barriers that are getting in their way, the results can be quite dramatic. While automatic enrollment or “quick” enrollment makes the process of joining a retirement plan less daunting, expanding the number of funds available to participants can have the opposite effect.

To mitigate this problem, consider a program of automatic escalation of contributions, developed by Thaler and his frequent collaborator Shlomo Benartzi, called Save More Tomorrow. Save More Tomorrow is a choice-architecture system that was constructed with close reference to five psychological principles that underlie human behavior: Many participants say that they think they should be saving more, and plan to save more, but never follow through. Self-control restrictions are easier to adopt if they take place some time in the future.

Money illusion: losses are felt in nominal dollars (that is, not adjusted for inflation, so a dollar in 1995 is seen as worth the same as a dollar in 2005). Inertia plays a powerful role.

According to estimates by the economist Lisa Meulbroek (2002), a dollar in company stock is worth less than half the value of a dollar in a mutual fund! In other words, when firms foist company stock onto their employees, it is like paying them fifty cents on the dollar. The upshot is that, in general, workers would be much better off with a diversified mutual fund than with company stock. (Hint: if you have more than 10 percent of your retirement money invested in the company you work for, diversify as quickly as possible.)

The combination of the low rates of return earned in these funds (barely above inflation) and the low savings rates by many employees is simply a recipe for being poor when you get old. Firms chose this option not because they thought it was smart but because they were worried about getting sued if they defaulted employees into something more sensible (but riskier).

Instead, the lenders have engaged in what economists call rent-seeking activities. The idea is that if there are high profits to be made, suppliers will be willing to spend a lot of time and money to get that business. Because excess profits are available to the lenders who snag the student loan business, there are temptations to do whatever it takes to get to the head of the line.

First, the state stresses the importance of the overall problem (ninety-seven thousand people on the waiting list) and then brings the problem home, literally (forty-seven hundred in Illinois). Second, social norms are directly brought into play, in a way that builds on the power of social influences: “87 percent of adults in Illinois feel that registering as an organ donor is the right thing to do” and “60 percent of adults in Illinois are registered.” Recall that people like to do what most people think it is right to do; recall too that people like to do what most people actually do. The state is enlisting existing norms in the direction of lifesaving choices—and doing so without coercing anyone. Third, there are links to MySpace, where people can signal that they are concerned citizens. In the context of environmental protection, people often do what they believe is right in part because they know that other people will actually see them doing what they believe is right. The same might well be true for organ donations.

Typically regulators have chosen some kind of command-and-control regulation, by which they reject free choices and markets entirely and allow people little flexibility in promoting environmental goals. Command-and-control regulation is sometimes embodied in technological mandates, through which government effectively requires the environmentally friendly technologies that it prefers; catalytic converters for cars are one example.

The first is to impose taxes or penalties on those who pollute. In the domain of climate change, a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, favored by many environmentalists (and economists too), is a simple example. The second approach is called a cap-and-trade system. In such systems those who pollute are given (or sold) “rights” to pollute in certain amounts (the “cap”) and these rights are then traded in a market.

We have three responses to this line of attack. The first is that reliance on a slippery-slope argument ducks the question of whether our proposals have merit in and of themselves. If our proposals help people save more, eat better, invest more wisely, and choose better insurance plans and credit cards—in each case only when they want to—isn’t that a good thing? If our policies are unwise, then it would be constructive to criticize them directly rather than to rely only on the fear of a hypothetical slippery slope. And if our proposals are worthwhile, then let’s make progress on those, and do whatever it takes to pour sand on the slope (assuming that we really are worried about how slippery it is).

The majority of “one percenters” are in that top stratum because they understand this dynamic—because, in fact, they themselves used the power of their network of contacts and friends to arrive at their present station.

Information, unlike material resources, is fluid: it can appear (be discovered or communicated) or disappear (become outdated) at any moment. Having the best information at the point of need requires excellence in collaboration, co-creation, communication—the engineering of relationships and the networks through which they get work done.

But I didn’t understand. I still don’t. His statement flew in the face of everything I knew. He thought of relationships as finite, like a pie that can be cut into only so many pieces. Take a piece away, and there was that much less for him. I knew, however, that relationships are more like muscles—the more you work them, the stronger they become. If I’m going to take the time to meet with somebody, I’m going to try to make that person successful. But David kept score. He saw every social encounter in terms of diminishing returns. For him, there was only so much goodwill available in a relationship and only so much collateral and equity to burn.

Look inside There are many ways to conduct a self-assessment of your goals and dreams. Some people pray. Others meditate or read. Some exercise. A few seek long periods of solitude. The important thing when conducting an internal review is to do without the constraints, without the doubts, fears, and expectations of what you “should” be doing. You have to be able to set aside the obstacles of time, money, and obligation. When I’m in the right frame of mind, I start to create a list of dreams and goals. Some are preposterous; others are overly pragmatic. I don’t attempt to censor or edit the nature of the list—I put anything and everything down. Next to that first list, I write down in a second column all the things that bring me joy and pleasure: the achievements, people, and things that move me. The clues can be found in the hobbies you pursue and the magazines, movies, and books you enjoy. Which activities excite you the most, where you don’t even notice the hours that pass? When I’m done, I start to connect these two lists, looking for intersections, that sense of direction or purpose. It’s a simple exercise, but the results can be profound.

“Welch might resent the fact that I say, ‘Jack, you’re a dreamer,’ ” says Champy. “But the truth is he’s a disciplined dreamer. He has the ability and sensibility that allows him to walk into various industries and see where the opportunities are.” Disciplined dreamers all have one thing in common: a mission. The mission is often risky, unconventional, and most likely tough as hell to achieve. But it is possible. The kind of discipline that turns a dream into a mission, and a mission into a reality, really just comes down to a process of setting goals.

Step Two: Putting Goals to Paper Turning a mission into a reality does not “just happen.” It is built, like any work of art or commerce, from the ground up. First, it must be imagined. Then, one needs to gather the skills, tools, and materials needed. It takes time. It requires thought, determination, persistence, and faith. The tool I use is something I call the Relationship Action Plan. The most simple version of the plan is separated into three distinct parts: The first part is devoted to the development of the goals that will help you fulfill your mission. The second part is devoted to connecting those goals to the people, places, and things that will help you get the job done. And the third part helps you determine the best way to reach out to the people who will help you to accomplish your goals. This means choosing a medium to connect, but, more important, it means finding a way to lead with generosity. It’s a bare-bones, straightforward worksheet, but it has been extraordinarily helpful to me, my sales staff, and many of my friends.

Once you have your plan, post it in a place (or places) where you will see it on a regular basis. Share your goals with others. This is very powerful and perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of having clear goals—there are hidden opportunities waiting to be accessed in everyone if you just tell them what you want.

But your goals must be in writing. Have the conviction to put your intentions to paper. An unwritten wish is just a dream. In writing, it’s a commitment, a goal. Here are a few other criteria to consider when filling out your Relationship Action Plan, or RAP: • Your goals must be specific. Vague, sweeping goals are too broad to be acted upon. They must be concrete and detailed. Know what steps you’ll take to achieve your goal, the date by which it will be accomplished, and the measurement you’ll use to gauge whether you’ve achieved the goal or not. I tell my salespeople that setting a goal like “I’m going to have my best quarter ever” is not enough. Will they make $100,000 or $500,000? • Your goals must be believable. If you don’t believe you can reach them, you won’t. If your goal is to increase the revenue of your business to $5 million in a year, and you achieved revenue of only $1 million last year, you’re setting yourself up for failure. Instead, set your goal at $1.5 million for the year—and beat the heck out of it. • Your goals must be challenging and demanding. Step out of your comfort zone; set goals that require risk and uncertainty. And when you achieve your goal, set another one. One of the best salesmen I’ve ever met is a man my father knew named Lyle, who sold books door-to-door. He would set annual sales goals for himself, write them down, and place them wherever he could: in his wallet, on his refrigerator, in his desk. Inevitably, he’d reach his goal months ahead of schedule. Then he’d simply write down another one. The man was never satisfied. What matters is the goal setting, Lyle would say, not the goal getting. He may have been the only door-to-door book salesman in Pennsylvania—or anywhere else, for that matter—who died a rich man.

Step Three: Create a Personal “Board of Advisors” Goals, like everything else I write about in this book, aren’t achieved alone. With a plan in place, you’re going to need reinforcement to stay focused. As in any business, even the best-conceived plans benefit from external vetting. It helps to have an enlightened counselor, or two or three, to act as both cheerleader and eagle-eyed supervisor, who will hold you accountable. I call this group my personal board of advisors. It may be made up of family members; perhaps someone who’s been a mentor to you; even an old friend or two.

During that time I wrote a detailed twelve-page mission statement asking such questions as, What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses? What are the various industry opportunities available to me? I listed the venture capitalists I wanted to meet, the CEOs I knew, the leaders I could turn to for advice, and the companies that I admired. I left all my options open: teacher, minister, politician, chief executive officer. For each potential new direction, I filled out a Relationship Action Plan. When everything was laid out, I reached out to my personal board of advisors. I didn’t have the qualifications to be appointed a CEO with a major corporation. Yet when I looked inside myself, that was exactly what I wanted to do.

From Clinton, two lessons are clear: First, the more specific you are about where you want to go in life, the easier it becomes to develop a networking strategy to get there. Second, be sensitive to making a real connection in your interactions with others.

Clinton illustrates how charming and popular you can become, and remain, when you treat everyone you meet with sincerity.

In business, we often say that your best customers are the customers you have now. In other words, your most successful sales leads come from the selling you’ve already done. The highest returns don’t come from new sales; they come on top of the customer base you’ve already established. It’s easiest to reach out to those people who are at least tangentially part of your network.

Sticking to the people we already know is a tempting behavior. But unlike some forms of dating, a networker isn’t looking to achieve only a single successful union. Creating an enriching circle of trusted relationships requires one to be out there, in the mix, all the time. To this day, every time I make a call or introduce myself to people I don’t know, the fear that they might reject me is there. Then I remember the Big Wheel my father got me, and push ahead anyway. Most of us don’t find networking the least bit instinctive or natural. Of course, there are individuals whose inherent self-confidence and social skills enable them to connect with ease. Then there are the rest of us.

“Isn’t hair a funny thing? So many people are just crazy about their hair. Of course, I guess it’s just natural.

She had been a good girl, had always acted like a lady, never raised her voice, always deferred to everybody and everything. She had assumed that somewhere down the line there would be a reward for that; a prize. But when her daughter had asked her if she’d ever had sex with anyone but her husband and she’d answered, “No, of course not,” her daughter’s reply had been, “Oh Mother, how dumb. You don’t even know if he’s any good or not. How awful.” It was true. She didn’t know.

So in the long run, it didn’t matter at all if you had been good or not. The girls in high school who had “gone all the way” had not wound up living in back alleys in shame and disgrace, like she thought they would; they wound up happily or unhappily married, just like the rest of them. So all that struggle to stay pure, the fear of being touched, the fear of driving a boy mad with passion by any gesture, and the ultimate fear—getting pregnant—all that wasted energy was for nothing. Now, movie stars were having children out of wedlock by the carload, and naming them names like Moonbeam or Sunfeather. And what was the reward for staying sober? She had always heard, There’s nothing worse than a woman drunk, and she never allowed herself more than one whiskey sour. Now, all the best people were waltzing into the Betty Ford Center, getting their pictures made, and having lots of parties thrown for them when they came out.

She could also never forget that gray, sterile, concrete-walled intensive care waiting room where she had spent all those weeks, frightened and confused, just like the rest of the ones waiting there; knowing that their loved one was lying just down the hall in a cold, sunless room, waiting to die. Here they were, perfect strangers, in this small space, sharing what was probably the most intimate and painful moment of their lives, not knowing how to act or what to say. There were no rules of etiquette. Nobody had prepared them for this ordeal. Poor people, terrified like herself, trying to be brave, chatting on about their everyday lives, completely in shock, pretending everything was all right.

The quiet hysteria and awful despair had started when she finally began to realize that nothing was ever going to change, that nobody would be coming for her to take her away. She began to feel as if she were at the bottom of a well, screaming, no one to hear. Lately, it had been an endless procession of long, black nights and gray mornings, when her sense of failure swept over her like a five-hundred-pound wave; and she was scared. But it wasn’t death that she feared. She had looked down into that black pit of death and had wanted to jump in, once too often. As a matter of fact, the thought began to appeal to her more and more.

First, we live in a new “abundance of choice in business,” in everything from products to career paths. Choice spells doom for difficult colleagues and leaders. “At a time when more of us have more options than ever, there’s no need to put up with a product or service that doesn’t deliver, a company that we don’t like, or a boss whom we don’t respect,” he writes. The second reason is what he calls the “new telegraph.” “It’s almost impossible for a shoddy product, a noxious company, or a crummy person to keep its, his, or her sad reality a secret anymore.” People are highly opinionated, well informed, and armed with the Internet. The bottom line is, if you don’t like someone, it’s easier than ever to escape him. When you don’t have others’ interests at heart, people will find out sooner rather than later. Our culture demands more of us these days. It demands that we treat one another with respect, that every relationship be seen in mutually beneficial terms. When you look back upon a life and career of reaching out to others, you want to see a web of friendships to fall back on, not the ashes of bad encounters. Here are a few rules I can suggest from personal experience to ensure that you never become a Networking Jerk:

Don’t schmooze. Have something to say, and say it with passion. Make sure you have something to offer when you speak, and offer it with sincerity. Most people haven’t figured out that it’s better to spend more time with fewer people at a one-hour get-together, and have one or two meaningful dialogues, than engage in the wandering-eye routine and lose the respect of most of the people you meet. I get e-mails all the time that read, “Dear Keith, I hear you’re a good networker. I am, too. Let’s sit down for fifteen minutes and a cup of coffee.” Why? I ask myself. Why in the world do people expect me to respond to a request like that? Have they appealed to me emotionally? Have they said they could help me? Have they sought some snippet of commonality between us? I’m sorry, but networking is not a secret society with some encoded handshake practiced for its own virtue. We must bring virtue to it. 2. Don’t rely on the currency of gossip. Of course, using gossip is easier. Most people lap up such information. But it won’t do you any good in the long run. Eventually, the information well will run dry as more and more people realize you’re not to be trusted. 3. Don’t come to the party empty-handed. Who are the stars of today’s digital world? Those writers, bloggers, and gurus who do the best job of providing information, creative content, links, or even just empathy to a community of like-minded individuals. Many of them do it all for free, and their reward is a devout following of people who, in return, offer as much as they receive. It’s a loop. In connecting, online and off, you’re only as good as what you give away. 4. Don’t treat those under you poorly. Soon enough, some of them will become “overlings.” In business, the food chain is transient. You must treat people with respect up and down the ladder. Michael Ovitz, once one of the most powerful of Hollywood’s super-agents, was said to be a master networker. By 2002, a scathing Vanity Fair profile, with dozens of anonymous and not-so-anonymous sources taking shots at the man, was a very public expression of a dazzling career that had somehow gone horribly wrong. People asked, What happened? Ovitz has some amazing interpersonal skills, but he wielded them disingenuously. People he no longer needed he treated with indifference, or worse. Former friends said that he wasn’t trustworthy, and that his relationships weren’t reciprocal. It wasn’t surprising that these same people not only reveled in, but may have also contributed to, his fall. 5. Be transparent. “I am what I am,” the cartoon character Popeye used to say. In the information age, openness—whether it concerns your intentions, the information you provide, or even your admiration—has become a valuable and much-sought-after attribute. People respond with trust when they know you’re dealing straight with them. At a conference, when I run into someone I’ve been dying to meet, I don’t hide my enthusiasm. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you. I’ve admired your work from afar for quite some time and have been thinking how beneficial it might be if we could meet one another.” Coy games may work in a bar, but not when you’re looking to establish a deeper, more meaningful connection. 6. Don’t be too efficient. Nothing comes off as less sincere than receiving a mass e-mail addressed to a long list of recipients. Reaching out to others is not a numbers game. Your goal is to make genuine connections with people you can count on. I’m embarrassed by the way I learned this lesson. I had always heard that sending out holiday/New Year’s greeting cards was a good idea. So I began a practice when I graduated from Yale to send a holiday card to everyone in my contact database. By the time I was at Deloitte, that list was thousands of people long and I was hiring temp help to address and even sign the cards at year’s end. Well, we all can see this coming. The intention was good enough until a college roommate noted (actually, gibed) how appreciative he was to get not one but three cards one year … all with different signatures. It’s not about mass, it’s about a real connection. If you’re not making friends while connecting, best to resign yourself to dealing with people who don’t care much about what happens to you. Being disliked will kill your connecting efforts before they begin. Alternatively, being liked can be the most potent, constructive force for getting business done.

Those who are best at it don’t network—they make friends. They gain admirers and win trust precisely because their amicable overtures extend to everyone. A widening circle of influence is an unintended result, not a calculated aim.

Before I meet with any new people I’ve been thinking of introducing myself to, I research who they are and what their business is. I find out what’s important to them: their hobbies, challenges, goals—inside their business and out. Before the meeting, I generally prepare, or have my assistant prepare, a one-page synopsis on the person I’m about to meet. The only criterion for what should be included is that I want to know what this person is like as a human being, what he or she feels strongly about, and what his or her proudest achievements are. Sure, you should also be up-to-date on what’s happening within the company of a person you want to establish a relationship with. Did the person have a good or bad quarter? Does the company have a new product?

Google. Going to a meeting without Googling someone is unacceptable. Besides leading you to relevant info, a quick search gives you something more subtle—a sense of how active the person is online and how much information they share. • LinkedIn. Take a look to see how you’re connected and what groups they’ve joined. Read their work history and summary info carefully. The summary will often reveal what they’re most proud of professionally, and perhaps what goals they’re working toward. Also check out their last activity on the site. • Twitter. See if they have an account and how they’re using it. Also look for a company account, and use search.twitter.com to see if there’s any ongoing conversation. • Literature from the company’s public relations department. Generally, most of what they have will be available on their company site, which you should visit first. But it doesn’t hurt to call and explain that you have a scheduled meeting and would like some background information. • Annual reports. They’ll give you a good idea of where a company is headed and what challenges and opportunities lie ahead.

You want not only to know who the players in your field are but eventually to be recognized as one of those players. The people who are on Crain’s “40 Under 40” aren’t necessarily the forty best businesspeople. They are, however, probably the forty most connected. And they probably all have lunched with one another at one time or another. When you get to know these people, and the people they know (including the journalists at Crain’s responsible for the “40 Under 40”), you’re that much more likely to be on the list yourself the next time it appears.

He’s the guy who founded WebMD and he’s started a new company, Convex Group, which may need your services down the line.

I asked John to send a brief introductory e-mail ahead of my call and CC me in the process. By having him copy me on the e-mail, in all subsequent correspondence to Serge, I could include John, and put some urgency behind our meeting. Tacitly, as a result, both John and I were now waiting for a meeting with Serge. As with so many business dealings, that alone didn’t do the deed. Serge was busy, and I heard nothing back from him or his administrative assistant after several e-mails. This isn’t unusual. Frequently,

Italians weren’t wops or dagos, and there were no more kikes, Japs, chinks, or spics in polite conversation. Everybody had a group to protest and stick up for them. But women were still being called names by men. Why? Where was our group? It’s not fair. She was getting more upset by the minute. Evelyn thought, I wish Idgie had been with me. She would not have let that boy call her names. I’ll bet she would have knocked him down.

For the first time in her life, she wished she were a man. Not for the privilege of having the particular set of equipment that men hold so dear. No. She wanted a man’s strength, so at the supermarket she could have beaten that name-calling punk to a pulp. Of course, she realized, had she been a man, she would not have been called those names in the first place. In her fantasies, she began to look like herself but with the strength of ten men. She became Superwoman. And in her mind, she beat that bad-mouthed boy over and over again, until he lay in the parking lot, broken and bleeding, begging for mercy. Ha! Thus, in her forty-eighth year, the incredible secret life of Mrs. Evelyn Couch of Birmingham, Alabama, began.

But he, Smokey Jim Phillips, perpetually down on his luck, had loved only one woman, and he had been faithful to her all his life. It was true he had slept around with a bunch of sorry women in sleazy hotels, in the woods, in railroad yards; but he could never love any of those. It had always been just the one woman. He had loved her from the first moment he saw her standing there in the cafe, wearing that organdy dotted-swiss dress; and he had never stopped. He had loved her when he’d been sick, puking in an alley behind some bar, or lying up half dead in some flophouse, surrounded by men with open sores having crazy alcoholic delusions, screaming and fighting imaginary insects or rats. He had loved her in those nights he’d been caught in a hard, cold winter rain with nothing but a thin hat and leather shoes, wet and hard as iron. Or that time he had landed at the veterans’ hospital and lost a lung, or when the dog had torn off half his leg, or sitting in the Salvation Army in San Francisco that Christmas Eve, while strangers patted him on the back, giving him a dried-out turkey dinner and cigarettes. He had loved her every night, lying in his bed at the mission, on the thin used mattress from some closed-down hospital, watching the green neon JESUS SAVES signs blink on and off, and listening to the sounds of the drunks downstairs, crashing bottles and yelling to come in out of the cold. All those bad times, he would just close his eyes and walk into the cafe again and see her standing there, smiling at him. Scenes of her would occur … Ruth laughing at Idgie … standing at the counter, hugging Stump to her … pushing her hair off her forehead … Ruth looking concerned when he had hurt himself. Smokey, don’t you think you ought to have another blanket tonight? It’s gonna freeze, they say. Smokey, I wish you wouldn’t take off like you do, we worry about you when you’re gone …

He had never held or kissed her, but he had been true to her alone. He would have killed for her. She was the kind of woman you could kill for; the thought of anything or anybody hurting her made him sick to his stomach. He had stolen only one thing in his entire life. The photograph of Ruth had been made the day the cafe opened. She was standing out in front, holding the baby and shielding her eyes from the sun with her other hand. That picture had traveled far and wide. In an envelope, pinned to the inside of his shirt, so he wouldn’t lose it. And even after she had died, she was still alive in his heart. She could never die for him. Funny. All those years, and she had never known. Idgie knew, but never said anything. She wasn’t the kind to make you feel ashamed of loving, but she knew.

You will, of course, need to provide enough information about your value proposition to make the person want to spend some time talking. But also, don’t talk too much. If you launch into a long sales pitch without finding out the other person’s thoughts, you can turn them off immediately. It is a dialogue, not a scripted monologue. Even my fifteen-second intro above left time for the casual “uh-huh, yes” or “hmm” from the other person. Don’t ever talk at someone. Give them time to come along with you.

In order of climate impact, they are: 1. CUT (slash emissions) 2. CONSERVE (get more efficient) 3. REMOVE (clean up what’s left) Avoiding greenhouse gas emissions in the first place—say, by electrifying transportation or decarbonizing the grid—remains our primary course of action. It’s both the fastest and most reliable way to cut gigatons of greenhouse gases today. Next comes energy efficiency, which gets us more output per energy input. The third strategy is the natural or technological removal and long-term storage of carbon. It addresses hard-to-avoid emissions, especially in transportation, industry, and agriculture.

To ensure a just transition, we must acknowledge the differences between developing and developed countries. There are vast disparities in their economic ability to move away from fossil fuels and in how fast they can go. We must be mindful of the millions of everyday workers whose livelihoods are tied to fossil fuels. They deserve retraining and quality job opportunities in our green future. Finally, we must recognize climate-related inequities within countries as well. Fossil fuel pollution has a disproportionate impact on poor communities and communities of color. They’re the least responsible for the crisis and least able to guard against its ravages. Those who are most damaged by carbon-intensive industries must receive their share of the benefits of the energy transition already under way.

First: We’ll need more generous financial incentives, mainly tax credits or rebates, to bridge the gap between the up-front green premium on an EV purchase and the buyer’s long-term savings on gasoline. That’s exactly what a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit, enacted in 2009, is designed to do. But we can do it smarter. Instead of credits being restricted to a model’s earliest buyers, they would phase out only after EVs are well beyond sticker-price parity. As Mary Barra points out, “You shouldn’t penalize the first movers for taking the risk.” Second: To speed the extinction of the internal combustion engine, owners need financial incentives to turn in combustion cars rather than resell them. A “cash for clunkers” incentive—better designed and more generously funded than the 2009 version—could clear millions of gasoline-powered cars off the road at a bargain cost. Third: The ultimate transportation policy would ban all sales of internal combustion cars, politely known as “the electric vehicles sales requirement.” This measure alone could achieve three quarters of the emissions cuts we need for the entire sector. At least eight European countries, along with Israel and Canada, say they will prohibit fuel-burning engines. China is working on a timetable. California’s governor Gavin Newsom ordered a ban for 2035; eleven other governors appealed to President Biden to follow suit on a national basis.

Then the Great Recession hit. Getting through it as director of finance was probably the hardest work I’ll ever do. When you are selling a hundred-thousand-dollar sports car during a recession, every macro force is working against you. We had taken deposits up-front and spent most of that capital on development, not inventory. We knew that when we went into production, we’d be cash-flow negative. We overcame the challenges by setting specific targets for vehicle cost structure, and we were fortunate that policy shifted in favor of EVs. By early 2010, we had stabilized production of the Roadster, announced the Model S, secured a Department of Energy Advanced Technology Manufacturing Loan, and filed to go public. Then, out of the blue, a recruiter called me. She said, “There’s a new position to create a cleantech portfolio at a venture capital firm.” I said, “Unless it’s with Kleiner Perkins, I’m not interested.” She replied, “So I guess we should be having lunch, then.” That’s how I joined the green team at Kleiner. I was part of running that first cleantech fund, and they asked me to focus on transportation. It was a great opportunity to have a lot of leverage in a space I cared about. The struggles with Fisker were actually a great impetus for shifting our focus away from passenger cars. None of us wanted to miss the rest of the EV sector.

Thanks to his dogged persistence, the bill finally passed. What became known as Scheer’s Law established the world’s first large national marketplace for solar and wind power. The idea was simple, brilliant, and effective. Literally anyone—an ordinary homeowner, a farmer with spare acreage, a retailer with roof space—could install an array of solar panels or a bank of windmills and feed power into a utility’s grid. In exchange, the utility paid for the homegrown power at a preset rate, locked in for twenty years.

The added costs were passed on to homeowners and some businesses as a surcharge on their electricity bills—for the homeowners, on average, less than ten dollars a month at the outset. A vocal minority opposed the premium on principle. But most German citizens backed the plan, which promised to generate thousands of jobs. Money began flowing in new directions, and clean electric power with it. Soon hillsides were dotted with wind turbines. Photovoltaic panels blanketed neighborhood rooftops. Long stretches of the Autobahn were lined with sky-blue solar cells. A Bavarian livestock farmer named Heinrich Gartner borrowed 5 million euros to install ten thousand solar panels on his land.

As solar and wind energy scaled in Germany, cost reductions worked their magic. New business models emerged. The green premium—the extra cost for clean energy—began to shrink. For a time, skyrocketing demand for renewables set off a manufacturing boom. Germany’s new “solar valley” industrial area, mostly in the former East Germany, created as many as three hundred thousand sorely needed jobs in solar panel design and manufacture.

While nuclear fuel yields virtually no emissions, it is not strictly renewable; it relies on limited quantities of radioactive elements. Nuclear plants last for decades and figure to remain part of the global mix. But as costs for this technology continue to rise and other options get cheaper, its role may be reduced in the future.

What’s unique about solar is micro-ownership and its potential at scale. That’s where grid parity could be achieved. We could empower homeowners to generate their own energy, instead of relying on a utility, and to create a distributed power system.

The up-front cost was zero, and they could lock in the price of their electricity for long periods of time. It was as if someone installed a gas pump in your backyard at no charge and said it was a dollar a gallon from then on. Would you want to keep it for one year or for many years? That’s how we got homeowners to sign twenty-year contracts.

But Sunrun’s solar-as-a-service model quickly found a market. The company’s 2015 initial public offering raised $250 million on the NASDAQ for funding operations across eleven states. Early investors were rewarded with a handsome return.

One solution is to make utilities develop better demand-response management. Another is to include storage batteries with all residential systems, so homeowners can store their power for use at night or the next day. If we can do this at scale, we can build what we call “virtual power plants.” Hawaii is an interesting microcosm where about 30 percent of homes have solar and batteries. Having so much scale enables us to provide more affordable and reliable power than the utilities. We’re now convinced that every home should have a battery, with grids designed to accommodate this model.

India set a target of 20 gigawatts by 2022, hit the milestone four years early, and is now targeting 450 gigawatts by 2030. Worldwide, solar is closing in on a historic milestone, its first full terawatt (1 trillion watts, or 1,000 gigawatts). Yet despite this rapid progress, we’ll fall short of our net-zero target without fundamental changes in policy.

Thanks to friendly state policies for entrepreneurs, it’s also the longtime leader for wind. In 2006, the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center went up in central Texas. Spinning 735 megawatts of power, it was the largest turbine farm in the world when it was built. (Since then it’s been surpassed by larger installations, led by China’s Gansu Wind Farm, which is twenty-seven times its size.)

We installed progressively larger turbines to increase the capacity of offshore wind farms. In collaboration with our suppliers, we kept bringing down the cost for each new installation. In 2014, we put in a bid for a number of U.K. offshore wind projects, the largest auction ever in this sector, and won three of them. That secured enough volume to keep our cost reduction program going.

When a new market opens, there’s often little competition. First movers gain a big advantage—and for the wind industry, Denmark had two of them. Vestas, an industrial equipment manufacturer, became one of the first makers of wind turbines and is now the largest in the world. But Ørsted was the first to see that offshore locations could be scaled far larger than land-based sites. Each of its early offshore wind farms generated about 400 megawatts.

Some utilities do a better job of this than others. A few have installed “demand response” systems with software connected to chips built into thousands of thermostats. In a regional power crunch, “smart” grids credit consumers who agree to have their air-conditioning reduced to cut peak-power usage. Another approach is “net metering,” where rooftop solar feeds energy back into the grid whenever a home produces more than it consumes. Beyond shaving solar owners’ utility bills, net metering is a win for the planet.

Lovins says that leaps in efficiency are so predictable that they can reliably accelerate our transition to a zero-emissions future. LED lighting, for one example, uses 75 percent less electricity than traditional bulbs. More efficiently designed pipes and ducts can cut up to 90 percent of the friction of pump and fan systems.

The next leap is to get rid of the old appliances entirely and install an electric heat pump that provides both services in one device. These clever systems both heat and cool and turn one unit of electricity into three units or more of heat, with industrial versions available for large buildings. While this technology still needs to drop in price, it’s ready and waiting at your nearest authorized dealer.
